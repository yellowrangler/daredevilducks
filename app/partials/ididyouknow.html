	We have updated our <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Team Stats Charts</span> (under Teams). We removed a number of confusing charts and added 2 New charts! Each new chart shows the complete Power and detail rankings for the team selected for offense or defense.  We also added the ability to pick which season so you can see how they might look from last years stats.
