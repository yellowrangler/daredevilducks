	We have changed <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Team Weekly Ranking</span> (under Teams) to <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Team Scores and Stats</span>. We did this because the page shows both team stats and all games the selected team played and how they fared. It's a great way to see how a team has done in head to head against all comers for the selected season!  
	<br><br>

	We have updated our <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Total Wins Leaders</span> (under Member Stats). We changed the label for <span style="color:#6C0000;font-weight:900;">Percent</span> to <span style="color:#6C0000;font-weight:900;">Mbrs Wins / All Games Played</span> and added a new column <span style="color:#6C0000;font-weight:900;">Mbrs Wins / Mbrs Picks</span> to show both wins against all games played in the season and wins against member picks made. Remember that winning the coveted DareDevil Ducks trophy is determined by total wins in a season. So percentage remains only a bragging right! 
	<br><br> 
	We have also changed the showing of <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Expert</span> picks for both <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Total Wins Leaders</span> and <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Weekly Totals Leaders</span> (under Member Stats). Showing the Expert picks must now be chosen by selecting the <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Show Experts</span> button!

	<!-- We have updated our <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Team Stats Charts</span> (under Teams). We removed a number of confusing charts and added 2 New charts! Each new chart shows the complete Power and detail rankings for the team selected for offense or defense.  We also added the ability to pick which season so you can see how they might look from last years stats.
