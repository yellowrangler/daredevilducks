            <p>You can select the <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Season</span> and <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Week</span> from their respective drop down lists.

            <p>The list displays team pairs (home and away) for the week. The total member picks for each team are reflected under the <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Picks</span> column. Team picks in <span style="color:white;background:#006600;">green</span> are the winners. If you place your mouse cursor over any team icon, you will see the icon turn into a picture of a graph <img ng-src="img/nflicons/statistics.png" height="18" align="top">. Selecting the team icon will bring up a window with competitive information regarding the two teams playing each other!</p>

This gives you a clear depiction of how the two teams compare via Standings, Competitive chart of team offense and defense, Power rankings from the pros and a numeric representation of the offensive and defensive rankings. Let's walk down the sections</p>

                    <p>First section details standings. The two team icons appear over the team  W L T <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Standings</span> column. The standings display the W L T information for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall record</li>
                        <li>Home record</li>
                        <li>Away record</li>
                        <li>Conference record</li>
                        <li>Division record</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Overall record is the teams W L T record across the entire league. Home record is the teams W L T record against other teams at home. Away record is the teams W L T record against other teams when away. Conference record is the teams W L T record against other teams inside their conference. Division record is the teams W L T record against other teams inside their division.</p>

                    <p>The second section charts rankings. Each team is compared offense to defense (O/D or D/O). The two teams are identified by a key with coloring. This uses the data from <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Team Rankings</span> with higher scores being better.</p>

                    <p>The Third, Fourth and Fifth sections display three sets of competitive rankings broken into:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Power Ranking</li>
                        <li>Offensive Ranking record</li>
                        <li>Defensive Ranking record</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> The ratings for these three sections vary from the previous chart rankings in that with these numbers, a lower number is better.</p> 

                    <p><span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Power Rankings</span> are the combined rankings inclusive of offense and defense for each team.</p>

                    <p>The following rankings for <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Offensive</span> and <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Defense</span> are further split into:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall</li>
                        <li>Scoring</li>
