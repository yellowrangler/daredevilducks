            <p>The Pick Your Teams page is where a member picks his or her teams for a particular week in a particular season.</p>

            <p>You are presented with a list displaying team pairs (home and away) for the week. You select a team by clicking on the <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Team Name.</span></p>

            <p>You can select as many or as few teams as you wish. Just be sure to have selected all teams for the week prior to the start of the game. Any selections made after a game starts will be blocked.</p>

            <p>After you have made your picks, you MUST save them by selecting the <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Save Picks</span> button. At that point a dialog box will appear that tells you how many teams you have picked out of how many were required to be picked.</p> 

            <p>There are tools that you can use to help you make a pick. If you place your mouse cursor over any team icon, you will see the icon turn into a picture of a graph <img ng-src="img/nflicons/statistics.png" height="18" align="top">. This is to remind you that  selecting the team icon will bring up a window with competative information regarding the two teams playing each other!</p>

This gives you a clear depiction of how the two teams compare via Standings, Competitive chart of team offense and defense, Power rankings from the pros and a numeric representation of the offensive and defensive rankings. Let's walk down the sections</p>

                    <p>First section details standings. The two team icons appear over the team  W L T <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Standings</span> column. The standings display the W L T information for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall record</li>
                        <li>Home record</li>
                        <li>Away record</li>
                        <li>Conference record</li>
                        <li>Division record</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Overall record is the teams W L T record across the entire league. Home record is the teams W L T record against other teams at home. Away record is the teams W L T record against other teams when away. Conference record is the teams W L T record against other teams inside their conference.

                    <p>The second section charts standings. Each team is compared offense to defense (O/D or D/O). The two teams are identified by a key with coloring. This uses the data from <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Team Rankings</span> with higher scores being better.</p>

                    <p>The Third, Fourth and Fifth sections display three sets of power rankings broken into:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Power Ranking</li>
                        <li>Offensive Ranking record</li>
                        <li>Defensive Ranking record</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> The ratings in these sections vary from the chart rankings in that with these numbers, a lower number is better. Power rankings are the combined ranking inclusive of offense and defense for each team.The following for <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Offensive</span> and <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Defense</span> rankings are further split into:</p>

                        <li>Scoring</li>
                        <li>Passing</li>
                        <li>Rushing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Overall</span> is a combined number across all defense or offense. <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Scoring</span> is how well you score for offense AND how well you stopped scoring for defense. <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Passing</span> is how well you pass for offense AND how well you stopped the pass for defense. <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Rushing</span> is how well you rush for offense AND how well you stopped rushing for defense.</p>
