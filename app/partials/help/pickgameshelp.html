            <p>The <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Pick Your Teams</span> page is where a member picks his or her teams for a particular week in a particular season.</p>

            <p>You are presented with a list displaying team pairs (home and away) for the week. You select a team by clicking on the <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Team Name.</span>. A selected team turns <span style="color:white;background:maroon;">maroon</span>.</p>

            <p>You can select as many or as few teams as you wish. Just be sure to have selected all teams for the week prior to the start of the game. Any selections made after a game starts will be blocked.</p>

            <p>After you have made your picks, you MUST save them by selecting the <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Save Picks</span> button. At that point a dialog box will appear that tells you how many teams you have picked out of how many were required to be picked.</p> 

            <p>There are tools that you can use to help you make a pick. If you place your mouse cursor over any team icon, you will see the icon turn into a picture of a graph <img ng-src="img/nflicons/statistics.png" height="18" align="top">. This is to remind you that  selecting the team icon will bring up a window with competative information regarding the two teams playing each other!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall record</li>
                        <li>Home record</li>
                        <li>Away record</li>
                        <li>Conference record</li>
                        <li>Division record</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Overall record is the teams W L T record across the entire league. Home record is the teams W L T record against other teams at home. Away record is the teams W L T record against other teams when away. Conference record is the teams W L T record against other teams inside their conference.

                    <p>The second section charts rankings. Each team is compared offense to defense (O/D or D/O). The two teams are identified by a key with coloring. This uses the data from <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Team Rankings</span> with higher scores being better.</p>

                    <p>The Third, Fourth and Fifth sections display three sets of competitive rankings broken into:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Offensive Ranking record</li>
                        <li>Defensive Ranking record</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> The ratings for these three sections vary from the previous chart rankings in that with these numbers, a lower number is better.</p> 

                    <p><span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Power Rankings</span> are the combined rankings inclusive of offense and defense for each team.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Overall</li>
                        <li>Scoring</li>
