            <p>The <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Team Weekly Ranking</span> page is where a member can view a seleted <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Team</span> rankings <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">for the Season selected</span>.</p>

            <p>You can select a <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Team</span> and <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Season</span> from drop down lists.</p> 

            <p>The list will contain every game (including post games when defined) in the season selected for the team selected. The list will display the teams record for the week including scores. This will be followed by <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;"><span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Power Rank</span>, <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Offence Ranks</span> and <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Defense Rank</span>.

            <p>The ranking list displays all seleted team games in week order. This can be reversed by selecting the <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;">Week</span> button.</p>

            <p>The Teams list scrolls inside and beneath the headers. We did this so that the headers would stay in place while the list data scrolled</p>

             <p>The Teams list scrolls inside and beneath the headers. We did this so that the headers would stay in place while the list data scrolled</p>

            <p>Team Rankings.com’s Predictive Power Ratings Model uses the Predictive power ratings described in the first three parts of this series.  To summarize, a computer algorithm iteratively analyzes data on every NFL game result this season.  In the end, every team receives a simple numerical rating (e.g. 92.4 or 104.7) indicative of its actual, documented, proven track record at outscoring opponents.</p>

            <p>Offensive Rankings are based on the highest to lowest Average of Yards Gained by each Team.</p>

            <p>Defensive Rankings are based on the lowest to highest Average of Yards Gained by the Team’s Opponents.</p>

            <p>The Offensive & Defensive Statistical Data is provided by SportsDirect Inc. via Team Rankings, LLC .  They are for the previous week’s game.</p>

            <p>Hopefully this gives you a better idea of how to select the winning team for each game.</p>
