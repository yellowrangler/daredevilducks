<p>
  It was a good second week of football. We had the usual close games and upsets! 
</p>

<p>
The Chargers and Chiefs opened the week in a back and fourth affair with the Chiefs eeking out the win. The Dolphins improved their record to 2 and 0 by beating the Ravens. The Jets in an upset beat the Browns in Cleveland. The Lions beat the Commanders. The Jaguars shut out the Colts in a stunner, as the Colts with Ryan were expected to have a championship year. The Buccaneers beat their long time nemesis Saints in New Orleans, which featured as much fighting as football!
</p> 

<p>
The Giants gave New York fans hope as they went to 2 and 0 with a win over the Baker Mayfield led Jaguars. The Patriots won a tight back and forth contest over the Steelers in Pittsburgh. The Rams got back on track with a win over the Falcons. The 49ers behind Garoppolo thrashed the Seahawks. The Cowboys without Dak beat the winless Bengals. The Broncos got their first win of the season over the Texans.

<p>
The Cardinals came back in spectacular fashion to beat the winless Raiders. The Packers crushed the Bears in Green Bay. The Bills again looked sharp as they dismantled the Titans in Nashville. And in the final game of week 2 the Eagles beat the Vikings!
