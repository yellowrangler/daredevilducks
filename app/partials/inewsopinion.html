	<span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Welcome to a new Daredevil Ducks Football Season!</span>
</p>
<p>
Week 2 is in the books!
</p>
<p>	
	The Patriots looked tired and lethargic in their loss to the Jaguars. The Jaguars on the other hand, looked well balanced. And kudos to Bortles for a well managed offense. The Bengals beat the Ravens in Cinci in an exciting back and forth contest. The Falcons finally won a close game by beating the Panthers. The Colts thumped the Red Skins. The Titans beat the Texans in a game where Deshaun looked confused and off balance. The Buccaneers behind Fitz-magic beat the Eagles. Fitzpatrick is making football fun to watch! The Chiefs behind their young QB Mahomes, put on a scoring show as they beat the Steelers. The Dolphins beat the Jets. The Chargers beat the winless Bills. The Vikings and Packers tied in an action packed game. The Browns lost to the Saints. The poor Browns found another way to loose, as they missed too many off the foot points. The Lions lost to the 49ers. The Rams crushed the Cardinals. The Broncos squeaked by the Raiders. The Cowboys beat the Giants and in the last game, the Bears held on to win against the Seahawks.
<br /><br />
  All in all a tremendous week of football!
</p>
<p>
	We had a great turnout this week. Thank you all again for participating. We hope you are having fun!
