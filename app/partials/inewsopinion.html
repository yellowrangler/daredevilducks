  <span class="newsOpinionHeaders">The Conference finals are in the books! On to the Super Bowl!</span>
</p>

<p>
In the NFC conference playoffs the Eagles beat the 49ers. The 49ers lost both their second and third string quarter backs early in the game. I have never seen such a thing happen. It was a shame as it reduced the game to a fete de complete for the Eagles!

In the AFC conference playoffs the Chiefs beat the Bengals. It was a competitive match up. Unfortunately for Cincinnati penalties where devastating. Especially the last penalty which put the Chiefs in range for a winning field goal!
</p>

 The Dolphins beat the Jets in a snoozer. The Panthers beat the Saints. The Steelers beat their division rival Browns. The Broncos beat the Chargers. The Eagles beat the Giants. The Seahawks beat the Rams earning them a place in  the playoffs and simultaneously knocking the Steelers out. The 49ers crushed the Cardinals and the Commanders beat the Cowboys.
