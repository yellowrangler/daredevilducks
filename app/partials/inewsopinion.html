<p>
A lot has happened since we said Good-By to all of our Daredevil Ducks members and the 2019 season. Not much of it has been good. We find ourselves in the midst of a pandemic which seems to have fermented the seeds of Chaos and thuggery. In this new world order, Truth, takes a back seat in favor of ideology. People are being demonized for their political affiliations instead of how they think and what they do. I shudder to wonder were this will take us as a country and as a democracy. But I digressâ€¦

	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>We lost two of our favorite members</span>
</p>

<p>
 <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Laura Cutler AKA Peanuts</span> passed away February 15th of this year. She was a Mother, Grandmother and more. She was one of our 8  original members and in that year became the first to win our coveted Daredevil Ducks trophy. Her graciousness and spirit will be missed.  
</p>

<p>
<span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Judd Jamieson AKA 18 Wheeler</span> passed away July 25 of this year. He was a father, grandfather, great grand father and military veteran. Jud was also a savvy game picker. While he never got the coveted Daredevil Ducks trophy, he was always in the hunt. One year he was tied with his Granddaughter (Tooth Fairy) at the Super bowl. But alas the fates did not favor him. He will be remembered for his life stories, laughter  and warm smile.

	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>Welcome back, Welcome back and Welcome back to our 2020 Season!</span>
</p>

<p>
On to football! Welcome back to all our 2019 season members! So much has happened in the NFL. Tom Brady is now a Buccaneer. Philip Rivers is a now a Colt. The only consistency I can find in the NFL is that Roger Goodell is still a certified idiot! Either way It should be a fascinating season provided the covid virus does not shut it down. 
</p>

<p>
I hope everyone is ready to start the new season. Who will win the coveted Daredevil Ducks trophy this year? Our last years champions Team Remington won by a comfortable 2 games! Show them the deference they have earned and watch out! They will be hard to beat. 
</p>

<p>
So who will it be this season? Will we have another repeat champion?  Or will it be fresh blood? Only time and skill will reveal the answer to that riddle! If you had fun last season, then feel free to tell your friends. Spread the joy!

<!-- <p>
This week is the Super Bowl (week 21). Lets review what happened last week.
</p> 
 
<p>
What a great game! The two best teams in the NFL had at it. The game went back and forth. The San Fransisco 49ers had the lead but could not hold on. In the end the much hyped Mahomes did what his Kansas fans prayed he would do - led his team to their biggest win in his young career. A great Super Bowl.

 All in all a superb week of football!
