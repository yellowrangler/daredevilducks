	Week 3 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Another great week of football. The Patriots came out their funk and put down the Saints in New Orleans. Question - What happens if you loose the first two games of the seanson and dont score a touchdown. Answer - you fire the offencsive coordinator. And that is exactly what the Bengals did after another stinker of a game against the Texans (who in spite of Deshaun Watson's moments of compenetnce still look like a second tier team). The Browns lost again this time to the Ravens. My heart goes out to the fans in Cleveland. The Buccaneers are definately a team to watch. They beat the straw out of the Bears who I though looked ok in the first week. The Steelers crushed the Bradford-less Vikings.

	There werer a number of close and entertaining games. The Chiefs continued their perfect record in a squeaker against the Eagles. The Dolphins and Chargers debuted Cutler in Miami. The game came down to another missed field goal by the Chargers rookie kicker. The Redskins avoided the dreaded 0 and 2 start for the season by beating the Eagles (there are very onerous statistics regarding teams that start 0 and 2. However, Mark Twain is quoted as saying that there are 'Lies, damned lies, and statistics').

	Other games of note found the Broncos pounding Dallas in a game that was momentarily stopped due to lightning. The Falcons looked very impressive in their pummelling of the Packers. Lastly, the Giants were defeated at home by a balanced looking Lions. All in all a great Second week.
