</p> 

<p>
In the Saturday Wildcard games - the <span class='emphasis'>Texans</span> beat the <span class='emphasis'>Chargers</span>. In the night game the <span class='emphasis'>Ravens</span> crushed the <span class='emphasis'>Steelers</span>! 
</p> 

<p>
In Sunday Wildcard games - The <span class='emphasis'>Bills</span> stampeded over the <span class='emphasis'>Broncos</span>. In spite of the large margin of loss, the Broncos look primed for next year. The <span class='emphasis'>Eagles</span> easily dispatched the <span class='emphasis'>Packers</span>. The <span class='emphasis'>Commanders</span> beat the <span class='emphasis'>Buccaneers</span> in an exciting contest.
</p> 

<p>
In the Monday night Wildcard game - The <span class='emphasis'>Rams</span> trampled the <span class='emphasis'>Vikings</span>. This was a disappointing loss for a Vikings team that showed so much prowess during the regular season.
</p>   

<p>
All in all a superb week of playoff football!
