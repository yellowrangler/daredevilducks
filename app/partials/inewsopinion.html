	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End of the Divisional Weekend!</span>
</p>

<!-- <p>
This was a curious week indeed. The Broncos were made to play without a quarterback, yet the Steelers and Ravens were permitted to push their match not once but three times to suit their covid issues! Doesn't seem like a level application of fairness and balance to me. What do you out there think? Remember the old days when you had a schedule and you were required to field the game with what players you had? Regardless of snow, rain, aliens or covid? Roger that!
</p> -->

<p>
In the first game, the Packers decisively beat the Rams. Then the Bills beat the Ravens. The Cinderella Browns turned into pumpkins as they were defeated by the Chiefs! In the final game the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the Saints for the first time this season. 
</p>

<p>
	So now the table is set. The Packers and Buccaneers will play for the NFC title. While the Bills and the Chiefs will play for the AFC title. Whoever survives those two matches will play for overall dominance in the Super Bowl!
</p>

<p>
  All in all another great week of football!

  Way to go folks!  
</p>

<p>
This officially ends the Divisionals. On to Conference Supremacy Weekend!
</p>

<p>
Games are continuing to diminish and the winning picks are becoming more elusive. So picking becomes more critical. Good look to the few that still have a chance to reign supreme at the end of the Season! 
</p>

For the rest of you. Better luck next week!
