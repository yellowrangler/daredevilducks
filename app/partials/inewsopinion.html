</p> 


<p>
Can you believe that we are at the start of a new <span style="color:#6C0000; font-weight:900;">Daredevil Ducks</span> season! Last year we saw the <a id="showpicture" name="showpicture" href="#fireworks"><span class='emphasis'>Philidelphia Eagles</span>!</a> best the <span style="color:#1280D6;font-weight:900;">Kansas City Chiefs</span> in the 2024 Super Bowl. We also saw fellow member <span style="color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;">Chris Burgin</span> win our coveted Trophy!

But you all know what a new season means! A time where all teams hit the reset button. And where all you fair Daredevil Duck members enjoy a chance to begin that long and arduous journey to achieving the 2025 Daredevil Ducks Champion Trophy!
