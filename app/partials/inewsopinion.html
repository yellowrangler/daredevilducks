	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End to the Ninth week of the Season!</span>
</p>

<p>
Let us all take the time to pause and be Thankful for all that we have!
</p>

<p>
In the first game, the Packers beat the 49ers. The Falcons beat the Broncos. The Bills in a bit of an upset, beat the Seahawks. The Ravens beat the Colts. The Texans beat the Jaguars and the Chiefs beat the Panthers. The Vikings crushed the Lions and the Titans beat the Bears.
</p>


<p>
The Giants beat the Washingtons. The Raiders beat the fading Chargers. The Dolphins squeaked by the Cardinals while the Steelers continued their undefeated ways by beating the Cowboys in what only can be characterized as an ugly win. But a win is a win. The Tom Brady Buccaneers had their asses kicked by the Saints. And in the final game, the Patriots edged by the winless Jets.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
</p>
