	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End of week 10 for the 2021 Season!</span>
</p>

<p>
The week got started with an upset and true thriller as the underdog Dolphins unhinged the Ravens in one of the most aggressive defensive games I have seen in a while!
</p>

<p>
The Bills got back on track with a thumping of the Jets. In another upset of sorts, the Washingtons beat last years Super Bowl champ Buccaneers. The Cowboys annihilated the Falcons. The Titans eeked out a win over the Saints. The Colts beat the Jaguars. The Lions got their first non loss as they tied the Steelers. The Patriots looked very balanced in a trouncing of a very good Browns team. The Vikings held on to beat the Chargers.
</p>

<p>
The Panthers with Cam Newton beat the Cardinals. The Eagles clawed and hewed the Broncos. The Packers beat the Seahawks. And in the final Sunday night game, the Chiefs beat their division rivals the Raiders.
</p>

<p>
In the last game of the week, the 49ers beat their California cousin Rams!  
</p>

<p>
  <span style='font-weight:bold; color:#FF6E3B;'>All in all a great week of football!</span>
