	Week 4 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Best week of football this season. The Patriots pulled another miracle win out of what is beginning to become routine. The defense is still looking shaky, but I believe this is fixable. The Thursday night game was an exciting offensive juggernaut with the Rams winning. The Browns and the Colts entertained with another high scoring contest. The Colts (former Patriots) Brissett continued to look capable in the win. The Eagles beat the Giants by kicking a 61 yard field goal with none or very little time left. The Jets won their first game of the season against Miami.

<p>
	This week was also a week for upsets. The Bills beat the Broncos in a stunner. The Steelers lost to the Bears in an exciting match. The Bradford-less Vikings showed that they can still play by trouncing the Buccaneers. The Titans beat the Seahawks in a game where Richard Sherman proved once again that he is a bully and jerk. Why he was not ejected is beyond me.

<p>
	Other games found the Bengals loosing again, this time to the Packers. The Falcons won a highly controversial game against the Lions. On a third down with 8 seconds left on the clock the Lions appeared to have scored a winning touchdown. Replay showed he had not. NFL rules require a 10 second runoff after a review stoppage. As a result, the game ended. I am sure this rule will be reviewed by the powers that be!

	The Chiefs continued their perfect record by beating the winless Chargers. The Redskins looked impressive in their thrashing of the Raiders. The Cowboys put together a great second half and trounced the happless Cardinals. All in all a great Third week.

	My Opinion 
</p>
<p>
	I find myself disgusted with not just the kneeling during the National Anthem, but also in the support it receives in our media and sporting institutions. I have no problem with taking aim at individuals who perpetrate bad behavior. Go get em. To ME, this country stands for freedom, equality and tolerance. High standards that give us promise and direction.
