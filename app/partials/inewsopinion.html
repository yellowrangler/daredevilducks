</p>

<p>
Can it really be week 7 already? Yikes. It has been a strange and curious trip to say the least. 
</p>

<p>
In the first game, which in this week was a Sunday game, the Patriots looked offensively anemic in their loss to the 2 and 3 Broncos. The Colts beat the Bengals in a close contest. The Lions hammered the Jaguars. The Falcons beat the disappointing Vikings.The Bears beat the Panthers, while the Giants beat the Washingtons. 
</p>


<p>
The Steelers continue to look like the comeback kid, as they easily dispatched the Browns. The Titans beat Houston and the Fitzpatrick led Dolphins crushed the hapless Jets. In a stunner to me, the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the Packers. The 49ers beat the Rams and the Chiefs came from behind to beat the Bills. In the final contest, the Cardinals crushed the fading Cowboys.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
