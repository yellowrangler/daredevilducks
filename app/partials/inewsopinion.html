	Week 14 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Only 3 more weeks to go! The Patriots looked AWFUL in their loss to Miami! All Patriot nation is hoping that this is an anomalous instance. Especially with the dreaded Pittsburg Steelers up next. The Falcons beat the Saints in a must win game. The Bills beat the Colts in what can only be called the winter wonderland game. Damn if that didn't bring to memory games of yore when all games were played outdoors! Manning was back, but that didn't help the crashing Giants as they lost to the Cowboys. The Packers sneaked past the Browns to keep their playoff hopes alive. The Bears pummeled the Bengals and the chargers did the same to the Redskins.

	In a seeming upset, the surging  Vikings came to a screeching halt, as they were beaten by the Panthers. The Broncos beat the hapless Jets. The Cardinals win dealt a blow to the Titans playoff hopes. The Eagles beat the Rams in the game of the week. But in so doing, lost their starting quarterback, Wentz, for the season. The Jaguars beat the shameless Seahawks. Shameless because they act more like 2nd graders then grown men. In another squeaker, the Steelers eked by the Ravens.
