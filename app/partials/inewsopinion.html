</p>

<p>
This week got started with the Buccaneers hosting the Cowboys in a back and fourth affair. In the end the Tom Brady lead Buccaneers eked out the win!
</p>

<p>
The Texans beat the Jaguars in Trevor Lawrence's debut. The Chargers beat the Washington's in a game where Ryan Fitzpatrick received an early game ending injury. The Seahawks beat the Colts. The Panthers lead by the Jets last year quarterback (Sam Darnold), beat the still hapless Jets with their new first round quarterback (Zach Wilson). The Bengals beat the Vikings in a competitive match up.
</p>

<p>
The Cardinals crushed the Titans. The 49er's got a lot of points on the scoreboard early in their game against the Lions. The Lions came back but fell short as the 49er's won the day. The Steeler's beat the Bills in a game that featured a terrible Steeler's team in the first half followed by a great Steeler's team in the second.
</p>

<p>
The Eagles crushed the Falcons. The Chiefs beat the Browns in closer contest then the score indicated! The Saints eviscerated the hapless Packers. The Broncos beat the Giants. The Dolphins beat the Patriots in a closely fought contest featuring Mack Jones for the Pats. The Rams beat the Bears. And in the final game of the week the Raiders beat the Ravens in overtime!
