  <span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Week 7 is in the books! On to Week 8!</span>
</p>

<p>
  It was a good 7th week of football. 
</p>

<p>
The week started out with the Cardinals beating the Saints. The Ravens beat the Browns in a close contest. The Panthers beat the fading Buccaneers. The Bengals bludgeoned the Falcons. The Cowboys beat the cowardly Lions. The Giants continue to impress as they beat the Jaguars. The Titans beat the Colts, ultimately causing Mat Ryan his starting job for the foreseeable future.
</p> 

<p>
In an upset, the Commanders beat the Packers. The Jets continued their winning ways as they beat the Broncos. The Raiders beat the Texans in a battle of 1 win teams. The Seahawks beat the Chargers. The Chiefs beat a disappointing 49ers team. The Dolphins beat the Steelers.
</p> 

<p>
In the final game of the week the Bears defeated a unprepared Patriots team in Foxborough!
