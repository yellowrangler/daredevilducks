In the final game of the week tragedy struck as Buffalo's Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest on the field. The game was postponed and at this time has not been rescheduled. According to the NFL website the Bills have announced that Damar Hamlin has shown 'remarkable improvement' and 'appears to be neurologically intact'. Lets all pray that he makes a full recovery.
