  <span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Conference finals Week 21!</span>
</p> 

<p>
In the Saturday Divisional games - the <span class='emphasis'>Chiefs</span> beat the <span class='emphasis'>Texans</span> in a game with very critical questionable calls against the Texans. It's hard enough to beat the Chiefs without NFL officiating seemingly being a part of the Chiefs bench! In the night game the <span class='emphasis'>Commanders</span> upset the highly favored <span class='emphasis'>Lions</span>! 
</p> 

<p>
In Sundays Divisional games - The <span class='emphasis'>Eagles</span> beat the <span class='emphasis'>Rams</span> in a rain and snow squall. The <span class='emphasis'>Bills</span> beat the <span class='emphasis'>Ravens</span> in another close and exciting contest!
</p>  

<p>
All in all a superb week of playoff football!
