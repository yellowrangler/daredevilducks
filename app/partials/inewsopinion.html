The mercurial Falcons beat the Jaguars. The NFL's juggernaut team the Ravens, pummeled the Browns. The Colts stampeded the Panthers. The Dolphins beat the Bengals in overtime, winning the game, but loosing the first pick in the draft. The Jets beat a struggling Steelers team. In an entertaining contest, the Saints beat the Titans. The Giants beat the Redskins. The Cowboys lost another must win game against the Eagles. In the upset of the week, the Cardinals beat the Seahawks. The Chiefs crushed the Bears.
