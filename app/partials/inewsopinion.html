</p>

<p>
The week started out with the Titans beating the fading Packers. The Falcons beat the Bears in a back and forth affair. The Ravens crushed the Panthers. The Bills held on to beat the pesky Browns. The Commanders looked competitive in their win over the Texans. The Eagles came from behind to beat the Colts. In another mostly snooze fest, the Patriots beat the Jets on a last second kick return for touchdown.

<p>
The Saints beat the fading Rams. The Lions looked tough as they dispatched the favored Giants. The Raiders beat the woeful Broncos. The Cowboys tied and branded the Vikings in Minnesota. The Bengals beat the Steelers. The Chiefs beat the Chargers.
</p> 

<p>
In the final game of the week the 49ers beat the Cardinals!

  All in all a superb week of football!
