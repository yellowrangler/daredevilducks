On Super Bowl Sunday, the Rams came from behind to beat the upstart Bengals!  A great game played by 2 deserving teams. Mathew Stafford, languishing with the Detroit Lions, a team perennial loser. A very good quarterback, perhaps even a great quarterback. Gets picked up by the LA Rams and the result is a Super Bowl win! Congratulations to LA Rams!

The Cincinnati Bengals did not disappoint as they pushed the Rams right up to the brink. They are a good team with a remarkable quarterback. One can only hope they will be back again! A remarkable job just getting to the Super Bowl! Great job Bengals!
