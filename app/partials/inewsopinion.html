The Jaguars beat the Dolphins in Jolly old England. The Chiefs beat the Washingtons. The Rams punished the Giants. The Colts stampeded the Texans and the Bengals looked good in their win over the Lions. The Packers held on to beat the Bears and the Ravens crushed the disappointing Chargers.

The Vikings beat the Panthers as the Cardinals stayed perfect as they dispatched the Browns. The Gruden-less Raiders beat the Broncos. The Cowboys held on to beat the Patriots. In the best game of the week, the Steelers beat the Seahawks in a closely played and competitive contest.
