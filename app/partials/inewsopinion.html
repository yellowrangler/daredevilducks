  <span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Conference Playoffs Week 21 recap!</span>
</p>

<p>
The Chiefs beat the Ravens in the first Conference playoff game. The Ravens looked out of sorts from the start. They played punishing football but didn't come together until it was too late. Meanwhile, the Chiefs looked very good in all facets of the game. This may be a great chance for them to win a back to back Super Bowl.

<p>
In the second Conference playoff game The 49ers beat the Lions. The 49ers were good enough to beat the Lions. The Lions coaching staff made a couple of head scratching decisions regarding going for 4th and short when points were there as a field goal.
