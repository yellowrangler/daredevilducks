	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>The Conference playoff Weekend is over! On to the Super Bowl!</span>
</p>

<p>
This week is the Super Bowl (week 21). Lets review what happened last week.
</p> 

<p>
In the first Sunday game the Chiefs won over the Titans. The Titans put in a valiant effort and actually had the lead early on in the game. But the Chiefs just played too well; and in the end overwhelmed the Titans. A great game! 
</p> 

<p>
In the second Sunday game, the 49ers beat the Packers. This was never a close game. The Packers earned respectability with a couple of very late charges but fell short. Rogers looked bored and unengaged in this mans view. Still it was a game worth watching, as the 49ers - normally a passing team - ran the ball most of the game with great results.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
