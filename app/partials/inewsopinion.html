<p>Dillie Dillie (Part Deux)!

	What a great Super Bowl! The Patriots had their chances and could not get it done. The Brady haters will, of course, have a field day. Still, what a great game. The Philadelphia Eagles did everything they had to do on both sides of the ball to win. Noles showed the world that he is one cool customer. He looked more like Brady then Brady did. Stayed cool in the pocket and passed with only one interception [and that was not his fault, the receiver bobbled the ball]. Congratulations to all the Phillie fans! You won this the old fashioned way - You EARNED IT!
