<p>
The Patriots beat the Giants in a game featuring the the Patriots defense! The offense looked a little anemic; but what the heck - a win is a win. The Panthers continue to look good with out Cam, as they beat the Buccaneers. The Ravens beat the now 0 and 6 Bengals. The Seahawks put it together in fine fashion to beat the Browns in Cleveland. The Saints with Bridgewater beat the Jaguars.
</p> 

<p>
In a stunner, the Texans beat the Chiefs in Kansas. The Redskins picked up their first win against the Dolphins in Miami. The Vikings crushed the Eagles. The Falcons found another way to loose to the Cardinals. The 49ers stayed unbeaten as they took out the Rams. In another stunner, the Jets beat the vaulted Cowboys.

<p>
The Steelers looked very good in their win over the disappointing Chargers. And in the final game, the Packers beat the Lions in a game with a slew of controversial calls that largely favored the Packers.
