	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End to the Thirteenth week of the Season!</span>
</p>

<!-- <p>
This was a curious week indeed. The Broncos were made to play without a quarterback, yet the Steelers and Ravens were permitted to push their match not once but three times to suit their covid issues! Doesn't seem like a level application of fairness and balance to me. What do you out there think? Remember the old days when you had a schedule and you were required to field the game with what players you had? Regardless of snow, rain, aliens or covid? Roger that!
</p> -->

<p>
In the first game, the Lions beat the Bears. The Dolphins beat the Bengals. The Browns looked impressive beating the Titans. The Vikings beat the Jaguars in a squeaker. The Raiders beat the sill winless Jets. The Colts worked hard to beat the Texans. The Saints without Brees beat the Falcons, and the Rams beat the Cardinals.</p>

<p>
In the first upset of the week, the Giants beat the Seahawks. The Packers beat the Eagles. The Patriots crushed the helpless Chargers. The Chiefs beat the Broncos in a close contest. In the second upset of the week, the Washingtons beat the undefeated Steelers. The Bills beat the 49ers and in the last game, the Ravens beat the Cowboys.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
