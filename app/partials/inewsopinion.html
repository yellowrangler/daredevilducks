	<span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Welcome to a new Daredevil Ducks Football Season!</span>
</p>
<p>
Week 14 is in the books! On to Week 15!
</p>
<p>	
What an utter debacle! The Patriots defense again made screen doors on submarines look water tight. At least the screen doors will keep SOME of the water out. Miami for the most part scored at will. It is a pity because the defense every now and then showed flashes of competence. The offense looked good. The special teams unit were Jekyll and Hyde; blocking 2 punts and yet letting a final play that never should have made mid field score and give the Dolphins a win. It will be interesting to see how the boys from New England react. I find that outrageous misfortune either galvanizes resolve or crushes the spirit.

The Titans crushed the Jaguars. What happened to the Jaguars this year? The Jets beat the Bills in the battle of New York. The Browns beat the Panthers in a game that meant more to the Panthers then the Browns playoff wise. The Panthers are still in the hunt (see Wildcat Wonders playoff bracket) but sheesh. The Packers stayed relevant beating the Falcons. The Colts beat the Texans in Texas. The Chiefs beat the Ravens in a squeaker. The Saints got back on track, beating the Buccaneers. The Giants beat their division rivals Redskins. The Chargers continue to impress as they beat the Bengals. The 49ers beat the disappointing Broncos. The Lions beat the Cardinals. The resurgent Cowboys beat the Eagles. 
</p>
<p>
In the upset of the week, the Raiders beat the Steelers. This was a shocking game to me as I had picked the Steelers to be a potential Super Bowl contender. But they are in trouble. They don't to seem to have any focus and that starts in the locker room. Another team that needs a little soul searching. The Bears beat the warm weather Rams in the very cold weather Chicago stadium. In the final game the Seahawks looked very good, beating a disappointing Vikings team.
<br /><br />
  All in all a great week of football!
