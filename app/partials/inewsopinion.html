	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End of the Super Bowl and the 2020 Season!</span>
</p>

<!-- <p>
This was a curious week indeed. The Broncos were made to play without a quarterback, yet the Steelers and Ravens were permitted to push their match not once but three times to suit their covid issues! Doesn't seem like a level application of fairness and balance to me. What do you out there think? Remember the old days when you had a schedule and you were required to field the game with what players you had? Regardless of snow, rain, aliens or covid? Roger that!

<p>
In their best game of the season, the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the high scoring and heavenly favored Kansas City Chiefs. Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs who had never had a sub 2 digit score, were consistently mauled by the Buccaneer defense. Meanwhile, Tom Brady, with a steady hand, made no mistakes and lead the Buccaneers consistently down field for scores. For Chiefs fans this was a disaster, for Buccaneer fans a dream come true. While a Wuhan virus plagued season may take some of the luster off the year for some, it was still a great game. Forget the Tom Brady story, this was a Buccaneers team that played with great heart against a Chiefs team that was not prepared! 
</p>

<!-- <p>
So now the final table is set. The Super Bowl combatants will be the Tom Brady Buccaneers representing the NFC against the Kansas City Chiefs representing the AFC. This is the second straight Super Bowl for the Chiefs. And this will be the first time any team has both hosted and played in Super Bowl.

<p>
  All in all another great year of football!
