</p>
<p>
Week 10 is in the books! On to Week 11!
</p>
<p>	
The Patriots looked like woeful against the Titans. One can only hope that this is a hiccup in a larger season. I am not so sure. The good news is that they enter the bye week. Lets hope they can find some focus. On the other hand, the Titans looked very good on both sides of the ball. This may be a turning point for their season. The Steelers eviscerated the Panthers in a rout. In this game the Steelers looked good. I mean really good as in super bowl good. Only time can tell. But they seem to be turning the corner of this season very nicely thank you. The Bears clubbed the fading Lions. The Saints pummeled the previously good looking Bengals. I would not be surprised at a Steelers Saints super bowl. The Browns defeated the disappointing Falcons. The Jaguars continue to unimpress with a loss to the resurging Colts. The Chiefs beat the Cardinals. For those who would ask why I pick the Steelers over the Chiefs to be super bowl bond; its because they have consistently found a way to fade. I hope I am wrong, I love Andy Reed; but thats my gut. The Bills embarrassed the Jets. The Redskins beat the Buccaneers in a snooze fest. The Chargers beat the embarrassed Raiders. The Packers got back on track by beating the Dolphins. The Rams squeaked by the Seahawks that featured the most outrageous non call for obvious grounding in the waning seconds of the game. Come on man! The Cowboys got some of their dignity back by beating the Eagles. And in the final game, the Giants got some help from the refs in their win over the 49ers.

  All in all a great week of football!
