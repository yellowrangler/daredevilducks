<p>
In the first game of the 2024 season, the Chiefs looked good as they beat the Ravens! In our first Friday night game of the season, the Eagles held on to beat the Packers in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Steelers looked tough as they made Kirk Cousins life miserable in his debut as the Falcons quarterback. The Bills beat the Cardinals in a back and fourth affair in Buffalo. The Bears beat the Titans in a sloppily played game. But as the saying goes an ugly win is still a win. The Patriots without Bill Belichick beat the Bengals in Cincinnati! The Texans beat the Colts in a close contest in Indianapolis. The Dolphins came out slowly but were able to ramp it up as thy beat the Jaguars. 
</p> 

<p>
The Saints crushed the hapless Panthers. Speaking of hapless, the Vikings pounded the ill prepared Giants in New York. The Chargers impressed their new coach Jim Harbaugh by beating the Raiders. The Seahawks beat the Broncos. The Cowboys gave their quarterback Dak Prescott a new 4 year $60 million dollar a year extension. In return Dak held up his part in the bargain as the Cowboys beat up on the Browns. The Buccaneers put a whopping on the Commanders. The Lions beat the Rams in overtime!
</p> 

<p>
In the final game of the week, the 49ers looked sharp as they beat the Jets, ruining Aaron Rogers return to football!

<p>
All in all a superb week of football!
