	<span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Welcome to a new Daredevil Ducks Football Season!</span>
</p>
<p>
Week 15 is in the books! On to Week 16!
</p>
<p>	
The Patriots and the Steelers put on a classic down to the wire contest. In the end, the Patriots could not find an open receiver in the final seconds of the game. It was a well earned and much needed win for the Steelers. The Chargers beat the Chiefs in this weeks thriller. Led by Rivers, the Chargers kept pace with the Chiefs finally surpassing them in a wild 4th quarter drive that culminated in a 2 point conversion winning the game by 1 point. The Texans beat the Jets in a close contest. The Browns beat the Broncos in a squeaker. The Falcons crushed the Cardinals. The Ravens beat the Buccaneers, and the Bills eked by the Lions. The Bears with Trubisky looked good beating the fading Packers.
</p>
<p>
The Bengals beat the Raiders. The Colts shocked many with a decisive shutout of the Cowboys. The Redskins beat the hopeless Jaguars. The Vikings mailed the mercurial Dolphins. The Titans punished the Giants. In another upset of sorts, the 49ers beat the Seahawks. The Eagles behind Foyles beat the vulnerable looking Rams. And in the last game of the week the Saints beat the Panthers out of the playoffs.
</p>
<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
</p>
