	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End to the Sixteenth week of the Season!</span>
</p>

<!-- <p>
This was a curious week indeed. The Broncos were made to play without a quarterback, yet the Steelers and Ravens were permitted to push their match not once but three times to suit their covid issues! Doesn't seem like a level application of fairness and balance to me. What do you out there think? Remember the old days when you had a schedule and you were required to field the game with what players you had? Regardless of snow, rain, aliens or covid? Roger that!
</p> -->

<p>
In the first game, the Saints beat up on the Vikings in a high scoring contest. The Tom Brady Buccaneers put such a whomping on the cowardly Lions that Brady got pulled in the 3rd quarter! The 49ers beat the Cardinals. In the most exciting finish of the day, the Dolphins behind FitzMagic pulled off a miracle ending as the Raiders were bordered and burned in the waning seconds of the game! The Jets beat the Browns for their second win in a row. The Ravens beat the Giants, and the Bengals beat the Texans.
</p>

<p>
The Bears kept their playoff hopes alive by beating the Jaguars. The Chiefs came back, as is quickly becoming their signiture, to beat the Falcons. The Steelers took the AFC North by beating the Colts. The Chargers beat the Broncos. The Panthers beat the Washingtons. The Seahawks beat the Rams, the Cowboys beat the Eagles and the Packers beat the Titans. In the last game of the week the Bills crushed the embarrassing Patriots.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
