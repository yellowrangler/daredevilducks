	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>Week 4 is in the books! On to Week 5!</span>
</p>

<p>
The Eagles beat the Packers in a thrilling contest to start the week. The Titans beat a mercurial Falcons team in Atlanta. After anointing the Raven's Lamar Jackson as the next coming quarterback, he and his Ravens were soundly defeated by the Browns. The Patriots beat the Bills in an ugly contest, but an ugly win is still a win! The Chiefs beat the Lions in a badly officiated game.
</p> 

<p>
The Panthers upset the Texans, and the Raiders upset the Colts. The Chargers beat the hapless Dolphins. The Giants beat a disappointing Redskins team. The Seahawks beat the Cardinals. In one of the largest scoring affairs, the Buccaneers beat the LA Rams. The Bears beat the disappointing Vikings.
</p> 

<p>
The Jaguars beat the Broncos and the Saints, without Brees, beat the tough talking Cowboys. In the final game of the week the Steelers looked good as they crushed the Bengals to get their first win of the season.
</p> 

<p>
  All in all a superb week of football!
</p>
