	<span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Welcome to a new Daredevil Ducks Football Season!</span>
</p>
<p>
Week 7 is in the books!
</p>
<p>	
	The Patriots were again last man standing in their win against the Bears. It was their first away win and it was not a particularly strong defensive outing. But a win is a win so... The Broncos bounced back with a beating on the Cardinals. The Chargers squeaked past the Titans in their game across the pond. The Colts beat the hapless Bills. The Texans beat the Jaguars and Bortles was benched. The Lions scratched their way past the Dolphins. The Vikings plundered the low flying Jets. The Panthers pounced on the Eagles, and the Buccaneers bordered and defeated the Browns. The Saints got heavenly guidance as they dispatched the Ravens. And the Redskins scalped the Cowboys. The Rams dominated the 49ers and the Chiefs overwhelmed the Bengals. The Monday night snoozer (Is it just me or are these ESPN announcers a bunch of babbling know nothings?), the Falcons clawed the New York Peewees.
<br /><br />
  All in all a tremendous week of football!
</p>
