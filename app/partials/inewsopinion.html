<p>
	Another crazy week. The Patriots hung on to beat the Chargers in Foxborough. The Dolphins got their butts powdered by the Ravens. The Browns continued their winless skid loosing this time to the Vikings. The equally winless 49ers lost to the Eagles. The Falcons beat the Jets in a close match under monsoon conditions. The Panthers looked good in their win over the faultering Buccaneers.
</p>
<p>
	The resurgent Saints beat the Bears. The Bills are beginiing to look like a contender as they easily dispatched the Raiders for a win. The Bengals did win against the Colts, but it was a comedy of errors on both sides. The Seahawks beat the Texans in best game of the week. The Cowboys beat the struggling Redskins. The Steelers continued their winning ways with a victory over the Lions. The Chiefs exposed the Broncos offense with a decisive win.
