	Week 7 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Another great week. The Patriots defense finally got some consistency as they kept the Atlanta team in check all night. The Pats also showed some running dominance which sealed the win in the home stretch. The Chiefs continued their slide with a loss to the Raiders in a nail biter. The Bills continued to show they belong by beating the Buccaneers in another thriller. The Vikings handily beat the Ravens.
</p>
<p>
	The Jets lost to the home team Dolphins. The Cardinals were pummeled by the Rams in London. A game that also cost Carson Palmer possibly the rest of the season with a broken arm. The hapless Colts were soundly defeated by the surging Jaguars. The Saints beat the Rogers-less Packers and the Bears beat the Panthers.
</p>
<p>
	The Titans beat the Browns in a snoozer. The Cowboys lassoed the at home 49rs. And the Chargers branded the sliding Broncos. The Steelers got focused and took care of business, easily dispatching the Bengals. Here come the Steelers. Watch out! The Seahawks did what was expected of them and beat the Giants in NY. And in one of the more entertaining games, the Eagles out lasted the Redskins in Philly. As I like to say, all in all a great seventh week.
