	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End of Conference Supremacy Weekend!</span>
</p>

<!-- <p>
This was a curious week indeed. The Broncos were made to play without a quarterback, yet the Steelers and Ravens were permitted to push their match not once but three times to suit their covid issues! Doesn't seem like a level application of fairness and balance to me. What do you out there think? Remember the old days when you had a schedule and you were required to field the game with what players you had? Regardless of snow, rain, aliens or covid? Roger that!
</p> -->

<p>
In the first game, the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the Packers in Green Bay. It was a great contest coming down to the last seconds. 
</p>

<p>
In the second game, the Chiefs beat the Bills in Kansas City. The Bills never got started as the Chiefs offense and defense dominated.
</p>

<p>
So now the final table is set. The Super Bowl combatants will be the Tom Brady Buccaneers representing the NFC against the Kansas City Chiefs representing the AFC. This is the second straight Super Bowl for the Chiefs. And this will be the first time any team has both hosted and played in Super Bowl.
</p>

<p>
  All in all another great week of football!

  Way to go folks!  
</p>

<p>
This officially ends the Conference finals. On to the Super Bowl!
</p>

<p>
This is it. The cream has risen to the top. Two will go in and only one will come out! Good luck to the few that still have a chance to reign supreme at the end of the Season!
