	Week 6 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Another week in a crazy season. The Patriots defense still needs work. The offence was able to put enough points on the board to beat the Jets. But an arcane rule spoiled the match. The Eagles beat the Panthers in a back and forth game. The Bears beat the Ravens in OT to keep their progress alive. The Browns lost again, this time to the Texans. The Packers lost to the Vikings and in the effort lost their star quarterback Aaron Rogers. The Saints drilled the fickle Lions.

	Is it me, or does the league seem to be loosing top teams as mediocracy settles in. Last years super bowl contender Falcons lost to the aimless Dolphins. The Redskins squeaked by the struggling 49ers. The Buccaneers lost to the Cardinals, while the Rams beat the Jaguars. The Steelers and Big Ben showed their steel by beating the undefeated Chiefs. Don't count out the Steelers. When focused they are formidable!

	The Chargers beat the Raiders, and the 5 and 0 Giants beat the Broncos at HOME. Really! Finally, the Titans beat the Colts in a badly played game. Still, all in all a great sixth week.
