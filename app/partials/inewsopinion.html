	Week 1 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	A great first week of football. The Patriots came out in pitiful fashion and basically laid an egg. But  the season is very young. The Browns gave the Steelers better then I expected, but came out on the loosing end. The Lions won a competitive game against the Cardinals by coming on strong in the 4th quarter. The 
	Redskins lost at home to a good looking Eagles team. The Los Angeles Rams put a serious hurt on the lackluster Colts. Though Brisset looked good as quarterback in his short playing time at the end. The Jaguars ruined the Texan's home opener by pounding them at home. Looks like their problems weren't just due to Osweiler!

	The Packers beat the Seahawks in a game that started out as a snoozer, but picked up momentum at the end. The Giants lost
	to the Cowboys and the Vikings looked very good in their win over the Saints. It took a late game field goal block for the 
	Broncos to salt the game away from the comeback minded Chargers. All in all a great first week.
