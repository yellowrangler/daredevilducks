	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End of week 8 for the 2021 Season!</span>
</p>

<p>
The week got started with the Packers beating the Cardinals in a real nail biter! The Cardinals were down in the redzone with seconds left in the game behind by 3, when Murry thew an interception to give the Packers the win.
</p>

<p>
The Jets beat the Bengals in a huge upset. The Titans showed their mettle by holding on to beat the Colts in Indianapolis. The Rams crushed the hapless Texans. The Steelers hung on to beat the Browns. The Eagles pasted the Lions while the 49ers beat the Bears.
</p>

<p>
The Panthers beat the Falcons. The Bills started slow but found their mojo and beat the Dolphins. The Patriots beat the Chargers in Los Angles. The Seahawks dismantled the toothless Jaguars. The Broncos beat the Washington. The Saints beat the Broncos but lost Winston their starting quarterback. In the Sunday night game the Cowboys without Prescot beat the Vikings in Minnesota.
</p>

<p>
In the last game of the week, the Chiefs held on to beat the lowly Giants! I like Mahomes, but I cant stand the way that he and the Chiefs are always treated with deference as if they are the presumed AFC and Superbowl champs. I am I the only one here? Lets see - did they win last years Super Bowl? Nope. Are they leading the AFC? Nope. Are they leading their division? Nope - they are in last place. So what do you say we just cut the rhetoric and call em as you see em! Sheesh.
