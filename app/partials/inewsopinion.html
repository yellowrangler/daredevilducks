</p> 


<p>
In Sundays Superbowl match up the <span class='emphasis'>Eagles</span> crushed the <span class='emphasis'>Chiefs</span> in a game nobody expected! The Chiefs this season have had a plethora of questionable timely calls. It didn't help that the game started inauspiciously with two questionable calls against the Eagles. 
</p>

<p>
But it was for not, as the Eagles began putting a serious whopping on the Chiefs. The Eagles defensive line kept Mahomes on the run most of the game. The Chiefs never really got going until late in the game where they were able to make the score look closer then it actually was. 
</p>

      <span class='emphasis'>Hail to the Eagles! Your 2024 Superbowl Champions</span>!
    </a> 
</p> 
  

<p>
All in all a superb Superbowl!
