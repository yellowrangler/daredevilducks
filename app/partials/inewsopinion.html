	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End of Wild Card Weekend!</span>
</p>

<!-- <p>
This was a curious week indeed. The Broncos were made to play without a quarterback, yet the Steelers and Ravens were permitted to push their match not once but three times to suit their covid issues! Doesn't seem like a level application of fairness and balance to me. What do you out there think? Remember the old days when you had a schedule and you were required to field the game with what players you had? Regardless of snow, rain, aliens or covid? Roger that!
</p> -->

<p>
In the first game, the Bills beat the Colts pushing their magical seson to the next game. Then the Rams beat the Seahawks in Seattle. The Tom Bradey Buccaaneers beat the Washingtons, keeping their playoff run allive. The Ravens beat the Titans in a close game. The Saints crushed the Bears. In the upset of Wild Card weekend, the heavily favored Steelers were beaten by the resiliant Browns!
</p>


<p>
  All in all a great week of football!

  Way to go folks!  
</p>

<p>
This officially ends the Wild Card Weekend. On to Divisionsal Supremacy Weekend!
</p>

<p>
Games are continuing to diminish and the winning picks are becoming more elusive. So picking becomes more critical. Good look to the few that still have a chance to reign supreme at the end of the Season! 
</p>

For the rest of you. Better luck next week!
