</p>
<p>
Week 13 is in the books! On to Week 14!
</p>
<p>	
The Patriots played and looked focused in their win over the Vikings. The defense seems to be jelling and the offense got a lift from a balanced running and passing attack. Gronk played well, but he still looks to me like he is hurt. The Cowboys put it all together in a win over the surging Saints. The Ravens beat the disappointing Falcons. The Broncos beat the fading Bengals. The Rams pummeled the 'Next Year' Lions. The Packers lost to the Cardinals, and in so doing, lost their head coach who was fired. The Texans easily beat the spunky Browns. The Dolphins squeaked by the Bills. In a back and forth contest, the Giants beat the Trubisky-less Bears. The Buccaneers beat the Panthers - putting the playoff hopes of the Panthers in jeopardy. The Chiefs beat the Raiders and the Titans beat the Jets. The Seahawks crushed the 49ers. In the game of the week, the Chargers beat the Steelers. This game involved 3 consecutive offsides by the Steelers on the final play of the game. Offsides which may have cost the Steelers the game, as the first field goal attempt missed. In the final contest, the Eagles beat the Redskins.
<br /><br />
  All in all a great week of football!
