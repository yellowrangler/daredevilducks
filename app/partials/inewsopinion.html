</p>

<p>
A crazy first week was had by all. As expected, picking first week teams proved elusive. In the opener, the super bowl champion Chiefs took on the vaulted Texans. Offense ruled the day as the Chiefs out lasted the Texans to start their quest for back to back super bowls.  Seattle beat Atlanta, the Bills beat the Jets, the Ravens pummeled the Browns, the Raiders squeaked by  the Panthers and Packers beat the Vikings in a back and forth contest

<p>
The Patriots behind running Cam Newton beat the Dolphins at Foxborough. Just doesn't seem right - no Brady and a running quarterback! Tell me it ain't so. The Washington's (will it really be possible to pick a name that offends no one? Whats the fun in that?) beat the Eagles in another back and forth contest. The Chargers beat the Bengals in a snooze fest. The Saints beat the Tom Brady lead Buccaneers. In a surprise of sorts, the Cardinals beat the 49ers. The Rams beat the Cowboys. The Steelers looked impressive beating the Giants. Antonio who! Ha! In the final game the Titans squeaked by the Broncos.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a fun week of football!
