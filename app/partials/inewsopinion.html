</p>

<p>
Its hard to believe that we are starting another Daredevil Ducks football season! Its been another crazy year, but lets leave politics aside! Players and teams have changed, and last years Super Bowl winners the LA Rams will be hard put to repeat. That is the best part of the start of the football season. Every team has an equal shot at the glory and accolades.
</p>

<p>
That is true for our Daredevil Ducks members as well! Who will be the champion this year? Many came close last year but just failed to win. Perhaps this is your year! But watch out because <span style='font-size: 20px; font-weight:bold; color:#00BBC0;'>Hygenius</span> will be looking to repeat as champion! Good luck to all of you!
