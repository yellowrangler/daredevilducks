	Week 11 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	We are getting into that time of year where the men separate from the boys. The Patriots beat the Raiders at a bull fight in Mexico City. The 7,000 plus altitude provided opportunities for field goals on testosterone. In the end the Pats played their game and Oakland did not - dropping numerous passes that could have kept the game close. The Steelers continue to look dangerous as they beat the Titans. The Lions squeaked by the Bears in a back and forth affair. The Jaguars beat the still winless Browns - but looked bad doing it. The Ravens pummeled the now hapless Packers in the frozen tundra. The Cardinals made too many mistakes as they lost to the Texans.
</p>
<p>
	The Buccaneers beat the Dolphins - Did anyone see that game? I didn't think so. The Vikings looked top tear by holding the vaulted Rams to 7 points in a 24 to 7 win. On the other hand, the Chiefs looked AWFUL getting beaten by the pathetic Giants. The Saints continued to earn respect as they beat the Redskins in a thriller. The Chargers crushed the fading Bills and yes, Virginia, the Broncos really do stink! Woof and Ouch! The Eagles are officially the team to beat in my book as they crushed the Cowboys in Dallas. In that game, the Eagles lost their kicker to concussion. That means no extra points or field goals. No problem - they went for 2 points every time they made a touch down and made them! I think they used a line backer for kick offs. Truly amazing. The Falcons beat the Seahawks at home in both a close and thrilling contest. All in all, another great week of football!
