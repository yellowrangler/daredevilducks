	Week 15 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Only 2 more weeks to go! The Patriots turned their last weeks disater into this weeks gem. This was one of the great games of the year. Either team could have taken this. This game had everything. The Steelers scoring late in the fourth quarter, followed by the Patriots behind Brady and Gronk seemingly scoring the wining touchdown, followed by the tremendous catch and run by the Steelers to the 10 yard line, followed by the Jessie James touchdown that has called back (and which will fuel debate on the definition of a catch for the off season rule makers. Tuck rule anyone?), followed by the interception and final score by the Patriots defense. And all of this in the last 3 or so minutes. Great game. It will behoove the football gods to have these two teams meet again in the playoffs.

	Now the rest of the games! The Broncos beat the Colts in a ho hum affair. The Lions beat the Bears keeping their playoff hopes alive. The Chiefs crushed the Chargers showing that they are the hardest team to pick/ignore! The Ravens beat the hapless Browns keeping their hopes for the post season active. The Redskins beat the Cardinals in a game that means nothing other then pride. The Eagles beat the Giants but not decisively, creating some to speculate that the Eagles run may be over. The Bills beat the Dolphins keeping their playoff hope alive. The Packers with Rodges lost a heart breaker to the Panthers. The Panthers continue to impress.

	The Jaguars bludgeoned the Texans and the Vikings did the same to the Bengals. The Saints beat the Jets to stay playoff active, and the Rams embarrassed the Seahawks. First game Russel Wilson was unable to dance his way out of trouble. A true statement game for the Rams. The 49er's beat the Titans in a close match. Remarkably, the Titan's are still in contention for the playoffs. The Cowboys beat the Raiders, but looked bad doing it. The outcome was in doubt until Derek Carr fumbled the ball through the end zone, sealing the win for the Cowboys. The Falcons outlasted the Buccaneers in another ugly game.
