	Week 5 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Another week in the season. The Patriots defense looked better as they kept the Patriots in it enough to beat the Buccaneers at home. The Jets beat the hapless Browns. The Panthers continue to look good as they beat the Lions in Detroit. The Colts and Dolphins both won in un-remarkable fashion. 
</p>
<p>
	The Bengals finally won a game against the improved Bills. The Chargers got their first against the pathetic Giants whose misery was enhanced by loosing Beckham for the Season. I smell a coaching change and soon! The Jaguars upset the Steelers who continue to have issues on the field and in the locker room. 
</p>
<p>
	The Eagles stay strong with an impressive win over the Cardinals. Though with the just announced addition of Adrian Peterson, the Cardinals should have more balance. The Seahawks beat the improved Rams, and the Ravens beat the Car-less Raiders.
</p>

<p>
	The Green Bay Packers pulled out a last second win over the Cowboys in a thriller. The Chiefs showed that they are for real by beating the Texans. It was a tough day for Texas as they lost both defensive standouts Watt and Mercilus. The Vikings beat da Bears in Chicago. All in all a great fourth week.
