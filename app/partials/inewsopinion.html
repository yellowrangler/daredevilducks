</p>
<!-- <p>
Week 20 is in the books! On to Week 21! Super Bowl LIII
</p> -->
<p>	
The Patriots are your 2018 Super Bowl Champions! Man I love the sound of that! This makes 6 Super Bowls tieing them with the Pittsburgh Steelers. In a age where football has been tinkered with to emphasize the offense, this was a throwback game; featuring the best defense I have seen from the Patriots since their first Super Bowl. This was the lowest scoring Super Bowl ever. Think about that. The Patriots held one of the highest scoring teams to 3 points. Booyah! Great Team. Great Chemistry. Dynasty.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a superb season of football!
</p>
