  <span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Week 8 is in the books! On to Week 9!</span>
</p>

<p>
  It was a good 8th week of football. 
</p>

<p>
The week started out with the Ravens beating the fading Buccaneers. The Broncos beat the Jaguars across the pond in Jolly Ole England. The Falcons squeaked out a win against the Panthers. The Cowboys crushed the Bears. The Dolphins won in a close contest with the Lions. The Vikings beat the disappointing Cardinals.
</p> 

<p>
The Saints beat the clueless Raiders. The Patriots beat the Jets. The Titans played well enough to beat the Texans. The Commanders beat the leaderless Colts. The hot and cold 49ers beat the Rams. The Seahawks beat the Giants. The Bills beat the Packers.
</p> 

<p>
In the final game of the week the Browns defeated the erratic Bengals!
</p> 

<p>
  All in all a superb week of football!
</p>
