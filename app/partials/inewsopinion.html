	<span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Welcome to the new 2019 Daredevil Ducks Football Season!</span>
</p>

<p>	
It seems like it was just yesterday that we were saying goodbye to our faithful members as the 2018 season expired! Yet, here we are again. Last years Dare Devilducks winner was 4Horsemen! 
</p>

<p>	
Who will be crowned 2019 Dare Devilducks champion! Will it be you? Or maybe it will be you! You will have to do your homework and work hard. And then pray that the fickle God of sports will have pity on you.
</p>

<p>	
It should be an exciting year. The pre-season has started, as have the big name holdouts. Who will win the 2019 Super Bowl? The Patriots won the 2018 Super Bowl, but that was last year. We have some new and exciting teams again this year. The slate has been cleaned and now it is time for the playing!
