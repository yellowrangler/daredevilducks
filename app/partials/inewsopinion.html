  <span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Divisional Playoffs Week 20 recap!</span>
</p>

<p>
The Ravens beat the Texans decisively in the first Saturday Wildcard weekend game. In the second Saturday game the 49ers won over the Packers in a closer contest.
</p> 

<p>
In the first Sunday game, the Lions beat the Buccaneers in a competitive match. In the second and final Sunday game, the Chiefs beat the Bills in a heart breaker for the Bills. Seems like missing last second field goals is still in the Bills DNA.
</p>

<!-- <p>
In the final game of the week, the Buccaneers crushed the disappointing Eagles. The Eagles are another team where changes will be coming!
