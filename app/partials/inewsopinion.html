</p>
<p>Weeeeeeerrrrrrrrre Baaack!
</p>	
<p>	
	Can you belive it? The 2018 football season is around the corner. Pre season games have already started. We at Daredevil Ducks are thrilled to be able to offer up another year of testing the whit, fortitude and savy of our Daredevil Ducks members. I hope that everyone from last year returns and if you have friends feel free to bring them along. The more the merrier!

	The new games for 2018 are now available to make picks on (No pre season games). This is for both the mobile website as well as the original desktop site.
