	<span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Welcome to a new Daredevil Ducks Football Season!</span>
</p>
<p>
Week 5 is in the books!
</p>
<p>	
	The Patriots continued to look strong as they dispatched the Colts on a short week at home. However, they still look dysfunctional in their secondary as the Colt receivers did us a favor by dropping as many as they caught! The Bills continued to surprise as they beat the Titans with a late field goal. The Giants and the Panthers played in the Stinker Bowl. Panthers won but is wasn't pretty. The Bengals beat the Dolphins showing to many (including me) that the Bengals may be for real. The Browns continue to improve as they beat the Ravens in Cleveland. The Lions beat the Packers in Detroit. The Chiefs slapped the Jaguars vaulted defense on their way to a big win. The Jets in the upset of the week, eviscerated the hopeless looking Broncos. The Steelers came back in fine form pummeling the Falcons in Pittsburgh. James Conner looked strong again gaining over 100 yards, which cant be good for Le Veon Bell. The Chargers beat their kissing cousins, the Raiders. The Vikings beat the Eagles in a close contest. The Cardinals won their first of the season as they beat the 49ers. The Rams squeaked by the Seahawks. The Texans beat the Cowboys in another close match. And in the last game the Saints crushed the Redskins.
<br /><br />
  All in all a tremendous week of football!
</p>
<p>
	We had another great turnout this week. Thank you all again for participating. We hope you are having fun!
