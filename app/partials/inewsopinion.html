	<span class="newsOpinionHeaders">Welcome to a new Daredevil Ducks Football Season!</span>
</p>
<p>
Week 19 is in the books! On to Week 20!
</p>
<p>	
The Playoff are here and what a great regular season we had. This is our favorite time of the year. Savor it as you watch it because it will be over in the blink of an eye.
</p>
<p>	
The Chiefs crushed the Colts at the frozen Arrow Head field in Kansas City! It is very hard to see who can beat this offensive juggernaut. The Chiefs seem capable of scoring however many points are necessary to win. Their next opponent will be the New England Patriots for the AFC championship!
</p>
<p>	
The Rams beat the Cowboys by exerting a familiar and regular pattern of running and passing. Dallas did there best to stay even, but in they end were overwhelmed. The Rams next meet the New Orleans Saints for the NFC championship!
</p>
<p>	
The Patriots stuck it to all the naysayers and crushed the Chargers in a game where both the offense and defense performed flawlessly. Their next opponent will be the Kansan City Chiefs for the AFC championship!
</p>
<p>	
The Saints beat the Eagles in the most closely contested playoff to date. Only a late fourth quarter interception sealed the win for the Saints. The Saints next meet the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC championship!
</p>
<p>	
So there we have it. The number 1 and 2 teams from their respective conferences will duke it out for a chance to play in the Super Bowl. Seems like poetic symmetry.
</p>
<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
</p>

<p>
	We had another great turnout this week. Thank you all again for participating. We hope you are having fun!
