	Week 13 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	I absolutely love this time of year. The Patriots beat the Bill's in Buffalo. Not a game to write home about; but a win IS a win. Unfortunately Gronk misbehaved and got suspended for 1 game. He is fortunate it was  not for 2. The Redskins continue to confuse as they lost to Dallas. The Vikings improved their position in their division by beating the falling Falcons. Don't count out the Falcon's yet. The Titan's beat the Texans keeping their playoff hopes alive. The Chiefs lost (again) this time to the Jets. What has happened to my Chiefs! The Dolphins beat up the hapless Broncos in Miami.
</p>
<p>
	The Colts lost to the surging Jaguars. Watch out for the Jaguars, they have a lot of very good players! The Packers beat the Buccaneers on the frozen tundra and in so doing kept their playoff hopes alive. Talk is that Rodgers may come back sooner then later. The Ravens pummeled the predictably disappointing Lions. San Fransisco with Jimmy Garoppolo beat the Bears in a closely played contest. The Chargers beat the winless Browns. The Chargers are my dark horse to make the playoffs. They are tied with the Chiefs and Oakland in their division.
</p>
<p>
	The Raiders beat the Giants in a game were Manning was benched, coaches decision. Ultimately, Macadoo was fired, owners decision. The Saints beat their division rival Panthers, propelling themselves into first. The Rams beat the Cardinals into playoff obscurity. The Eagles lost to the Seahawks in a game where Wilson showed why he should be MVP if the Seahawks go anywhere in the playoffs. The Steelers pulled out a close win coming from behind in a chippy afair with the Bengals. All in all, another great week of football!
