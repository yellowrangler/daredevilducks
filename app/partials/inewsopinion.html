	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>The Wild Card Weekend is over! On to the Divisional Playoffs!</span>
</p>

<p>
I hope you all had a Happy New Year! This week is the round 2 Divisional Playoffs (week 19). Lets review what happened last week.
</p> 

<p>
In the first Saturday game the Texans won in a real nail biter over the impressive Bills. Deshaun Watson looked every part the franchise player, as he took control when it counted. Josh Allen showed remarkable skills but made some classic mistakes at crunch time. A great game none the less! 
</p> 

<p>
In the second Saturday game, the Titans, behind the punishing running of Henry,  rolled over the hapless Patriots. The Patriots did shut Henry down in the second half, but were unable to take advantage of a first and goal which resulted in a field goal. Now Patriots nation is left to ponder the state of the team moving forward.
</p> 

<p>
In the first Sunday game, the Vikings pulled an upset of sorts by beating the Saints in New Orleans in Overtime. Cousins looked poised and was on target as he showed he could win a playoff game. The Vikings defense did the rest. Pressing the Saints offense into 2 turnovers. 
</p> 

<p>
In the second Sunday game, the Seahawks beat the Eagles. The Eagles lost their starting quarterback when his head was slammed into the ground during a tackle. No call by the refs. Damn if I can figure out what constitutes a penalty any more. 
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!

It is now a small fraternity of those who can be a Daredevil ducks champion. To those few, pick wisely as the number of games is coming to a dramatic close. Good luck to all! To the rest of us (including myself), enjoy the sprint to the finish!
