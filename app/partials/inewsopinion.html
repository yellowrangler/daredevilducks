	Week 12 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Teams are starting to feel the heat as we continue through the season. The Patriots beat the Dolphins at home. The Vikings showed their grit by beating the Lions in Detroit against a division rival. The Chargers kept their playoff hopes alive by beating the now hapless Cowboys. The Giants continued to look awful as they took it in the chin from the Redskins. The Titan's beat the Colts in a clash of the weeinies. The Eagle had their way with the Bears and the Panthers beat the disappearing Jets.
</p>
<p>
	The Falcons beat the Buccaneers. The Bengals beat the winless Browns. The Chiefs have clearly lost their Mojo as they were beaten by the Bills in Kansas City! The Seahawks beat the 49ers in a game that showcased Garoppolo in the final minutes. He looked good moving the ball and scoring a touchdown. The Rams beat the Saints in a true clash of scoring teams. The Cardinals beat the Jaguars in a back and forth affair. The Raiders kept their playoff hopes alive by beating the Broncos. The Packers lost a close game to the Steelers and the Ravens beat the Texans. All in all, another great week of football!
