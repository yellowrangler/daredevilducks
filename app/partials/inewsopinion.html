	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>Week 11 is in the books! On to Week 12!</span>
</p>

<p>
I hope everyone had a fine Halloween! Here comes Thanksgiving and soon after that Christmas. This year has been a great year for football, and this week was no exception.   
</p> 

<p>
The Browns beat the Steelers in a game that featured helmets being ripped off and then used as a club! Tough division loss for the Steelers. In the battle of the young guns, Lamar Jackson and his Ravens won out over the Texans. The rejuvenated Falcons beat the Panthers. The Cowboys eased by the hopeless home team Lions. Brissetts Colts bludgeoned the hopeless Jaguars ruining Nick Foles return.
</p> 

<p>
The Bills squished the fish, as they beat the 2 and 8 Dolphins. The Vikings mounted a remarkable comeback to embarrass the Broncos. The Saints crushed the Buccaneers with Winston giving up 4 interceptions. One has to wonder how much longer the Buccaneers are going to require his services. The Jets beat up on the 1 and 9 Redskins. The 49ers beat the much improved Cardinals. The Raiders beat the winless Bengals. I mean who hasn't! 
</p> 

<p>
The Patriots defense prevented the Eagles from scoring in the second half, as they beat them by 7. Even though the Pats offense looked iffy; remember that the on field conditions were atrocious and while their offensive numbers sounded bad the numbers that counted looked good! The Rams beat the fading Bears. In the final contest, the Chiefs beat the Chargers in a game that found Rivers  unable to make key plays.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
</p> 

<p>
We had another great turnout this week. Thank you all again for participating.
