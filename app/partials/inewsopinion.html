	Week 5 Roundup
</p>
<p>
	Another week in this crazy season. The Patriots defense put in another stinker against the Panthers. Much will have to improve if we expect even a whiff of post season. The Saints pounded the hapless Dolphins. The Titan's in a week eerily reminiscent of last seasons final regular week found both Oakland and Titan's quarterbacks knocked out of the game. Speaking of the Titan's, they were pounded by the Texans. Deshaun Watson is beginning to look more and more like the real thing.

	The Jets beat the Jaguars in a close game. The Lions won a contested match against the much improved Vikings. The Steelers put the hammer on the Ravens. The Bengals finally won a game against the winless Browns. The Rams beat the Cowboys in a great offensive contest.  The Eagles dispatched the poor Chargers in a close game.

	This week had one big upset as the Bills beat the Falcons to take first place in their division. Is this the year for the Bills? The Giants lost again, this time to the Buccaneers. The Cardinals and Broncos eked eked out wins. The Seahawks destroyed the Colts and the Chiefs won a cliff hanger against the Redskins. All in all a great Third week.
