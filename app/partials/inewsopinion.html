	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>It is the Start of the 20201 Season!</span>
</p>

<p>
Last year the Buccaneers had a magical dream season. The kind of season only Disney could have written, and then cashed in on. But now the competition starts anew. All teams are poised at the starting line looking to make this year their dream year. Who will it be? 
</p>

<p>
And which one of our Dare Devilducks members will have the savvy and brains to take the crown!  Last year we had our first ever tie for first place. A three way tie at that! They were <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Alaskan Fisherman</span>, <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>SandyR</span>. and <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Skinny</span>!
</p>

<p>
Last year we also lost two of our most beloved members - Laura Cutler (Peanuts) and Judd Jamieson (18 Wheeler). Both will be deeply missed, not just for their dedicated love of the game but also for their love of their families and friends. There generation provided the standard the rest of us live by. Or should.
</p>

<p>
Between COVID and the rise of woke-ness, the world seems to have turned its back on fun and adventure! But who knows, perhaps this is the year when things turn for the best. So lets put on our favorite teams clothing and have some fun! After all that is what Dare Devilducks is all about!
</p>

So now the final table is set. The Super Bowl combatants will be the Tom Brady Buccaneers representing the NFC against the Kansas City Chiefs representing the AFC. This is the second straight Super Bowl for the Chiefs. And this will be the first time any team has both hosted and played in Super Bowl.
