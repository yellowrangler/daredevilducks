</p>

<p>
The Chiefs crushed the Broncos in a game where Mahomes was injured. The Rams got a much needed win over the hapless Falcons. Expect coaching changes soon. Atlanta is a great sports town and they deserve better. The Bills defeated the winless Dolphins in spite of a good showing by Fitz-magic. The Jaguars continued the Bengals winless streak in Cincinnati.

<p>
The Vikings behind Cousins looked very good in their win over the Lions. The Lions never seem to be able to finish the deal; always a bridesmaid never a bride! The Packers thumped the Raiders. In an upset of sorts, the Colts at home beat the much ballyhooed Texans. The Cardinals beat the Giants in the battle of the bottom dwellers. The 49ers beat the Redskins a low scoring affair in Washington. The highlight of the game was the 49ers Nick Bosa body surfing across the monsoon soaked field looking like a kid on a slip and slide.

The disappointing Chargers lost to the Titans. The Saints continued winning without Brees, beating the Bears who got their starting quarterback, Trubisky back. The Ravens spanked the Seahawks in a game featuring the running prowess of Lamar Jackson. The Cowboys decisively beat the Eagles in Dallas. In the final contest, the Patriots embarrassed the Jets.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
