	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>End to the Fifteenth week of the Season!</span>
</p>

<!-- <p>
This was a curious week indeed. The Broncos were made to play without a quarterback, yet the Steelers and Ravens were permitted to push their match not once but three times to suit their covid issues! Doesn't seem like a level application of fairness and balance to me. What do you out there think? Remember the old days when you had a schedule and you were required to field the game with what players you had? Regardless of snow, rain, aliens or covid? Roger that!
</p> -->

<p>
In the first game, the Chargers beat the fading Raiders. The Bill's stampeded the Broncos. The Packers put the Panthers in cold storage. The Colts beat the Texans. The Titans crushed the Lions, the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the Falcons and the Ravens beat the Jaguars. The Dolphins beat the disappointing Patriots and the Bears mauled the Vikings.
</p>

<p>
The Seahawks squeaked past the Washingtons. The Cowboys lassoed the 49ers. The Jets won their first game against the Rams. The Cardinals beat the Eagles. The Chiefs inched by the Saints, and the Browns dominated the Giants. In the final game of the week, the Bengals with their 3rd string quarterback gave the Steelers their third straight loss.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
