	<span class='newsOpinionHeaders'>Week 14 is in the books! On to Week 15!</span>
</p>

<p>
Winter is officially here (snow - not the December Solstice), Christmas continues to surge relentlessly towards us! And in the midst of it all is football!
</p> 

<p>
In the first match of the week, the Bears beat the stumbling 6 and 7 Cowboys. Strangely enough, the Cowboys can still win their Division and get a bye for the first round of the playoffs - if they beat the Eagles later in the season. The Falcons beat the plummeting Panthers. The Ravens beat the Bills in a thriller. The Browns just managed to squeak past the Bengals. The Packers beat the Redskins.
</p> 

<p>
In an upset of sorts, the Broncos crushed the Texans. The Vikings plundered the anemic Lions. In the game of the week, the 49ers beat the Saints with a last second field goal. The Jets beat the Dolphins, and the Buccaneers beat the Colts. The Chargers found their game as they pummeled the Jaguars. The Steelers beat the Cardinals. In a game marred by bad officiating, the Chiefs beat the Patriots in Foxborough.
</p> 

<p>
The rejuvenated Titans torched the Raiders. The Rams showed grit as they beat the Seahawks. And in the final game of the week, the Eagles beat the Giants in overtime. 
</p>

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
</p> 

<p>
We had another great turnout this week. Thank you all again for participating.
