How to build new NFL Dare Devil Ducks Season New


1. Go to the website http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/xxxx/games.htm where xxxx is the NFL season (eg 2023) and create csv game file. Screen scrape (copy the relevant items) copy into a spreadsheet a pear down. s a file named 2023NFLSeasonSchedule.csv

2. Add the bye teams. I used this url for 2023 https://www.footballdiehards.com/nfl-bye-weeks.cfm. Again screen scrape (copy the relevant items) copy into a spreadsheet a pear down. Create a file named 2023NFLSeasonbye.csv

3. Bring YYYYNFLSeasonGameWeeks up where YYYY is last years csv file. Make appropriate changes for new NFL season. This is a crucial file and is monotonous and tedious. The week starts on a Thursday (Yes Thursday) and ends on Tuesday.      

NFL in a nutshell: 32 teams, each play 17 games in regular season that spans 18 weeks. Each team gets a bye week - where players can rest. After the regular season, playoffs begin. 12 teams qualify for playoffs. Playoffs consists of wildcard week, divisional week, conference championships, a bye-week and ends with SuperBowl. So 18 weeks + 3 playoffs + Super Bowl = 22 weeks!

4. At this time make any changes to team names or locations via the admin screen.

5. DO A COMPLETE BACKUP OF THE DDD DATABASE. This way you can stop and re-add data if you make a mistake.  Use the following command: mysqldump --extended-insert=FALSE --complete-insert=TRUE -u tarryc -ptarryc ddd > ddd-dump-nflxxxx.sql. 

If you need to restore the backup you must do it from the linux command line. EG. mysql -u tarryc -p ddd < ddd-dump-nfl2015-bkup.sql

6. Go to the admin screen -> System scripts -> choose New Season Setup. Put appropriate file names into each input field and hit button.

7. Your new NFL season should now be up. Next Statistics and images.

8. Go to System Scripts under Admin and select “Run Game scripts”. Review all tables to see if populated.

9. You must import last seasons last TeamWeeklyRanking and rename it to be first before EG TeamWeekRank2025W1Before.csv. If you dont do this the stats that pop up will be broken. 

10. Add new images.

11. Get injury reports from https://www.rotowire.com/football/injury-report.php. Clean up a css file and review injury folder in sys directory for tools to create for import.
