Don: Screen name (and login) and password is "4Horsemen"

To choose first game you must first login. You will see your avatar on the top right of the screen(send me one I hav set a default for you). Choose "Games" button (donald duck with football) and select "Pick games for week".  Have fun playing around. Remember that we are still a work in process.

Some people have reported that the website does not do well on an ipad or other small mobile device. So I suggest using a laptop or desktop.
