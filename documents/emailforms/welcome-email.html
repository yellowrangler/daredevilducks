Hi <span style='color:teal;'>Marc</span>,

To choose a game you must first login. You will see your avatar on the top right of the screen (Marc - you can send me a new one if you wish). Choose "Games" button (donald duck with football) and select "Pick Your Teams for the Week's Games".  Have fun playing around. Remember that we are still a work in process.
</p>

<p>
If you need to see what you have picked choose "Each Player's picks for week". It will default to you and show you in bright red what you picked. Teams that have already played and won have their score in green. I disable game selection once the game starts.
</p>

<p>Glad to have you aboard</p>
