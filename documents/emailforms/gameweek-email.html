Daredevil Ducks - Week 7 Review and Week 8 ahead!

<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:black;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
We may have to call in our Daredevil Ducks League commisioner - Goofey! For it appears there must have been collusion amongst the Jamieson/Hunzelman families! How else can we explain their all being in the top 4 for Week 7! Another great week for games. The Pats eeked out a victory over the much improved Jets and the Cardinals game was a cliff hanger at the end. Who doesn't like a well executed onside kick. Woof!
</p>

<p>More movement on the leader board, as Peanuts has been dethroned after 6 weeks at the top. Wildcat Wonder is now ensconced in first with a comfortable padding of 4 games. She also has taken top ranking as percentage leader. Additionaly, Toothfairy has moved into a second place tie with Peanuts, passing her sister NFL Amateur! Love that sibling rivalry. The stats are below:
