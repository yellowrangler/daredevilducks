Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
Another crazy week! The Pats continue to look good as do the Packers. The Steelers need big Ben back as it seems like the experiment with Vick aint working. All in all though it sure is a lot of fun to watch. We have a rookie siting in our top 3! Jessica aka NFL Amateur has broken the glass ceiling and is now in 3rd place with her Auntie (Wildcat Wonder). The stats are below:

We continue to improve the website. We have added Bye Teams at the bottom of the pick and view picks pages. To make it easier to see what you have picked; we now turn the selected team red when you select it (You still have to save the pick remember). Additionally, Clicking on any team logo will open a new browser page and take you to that teams official website. Look for new team stats pages soon. These will hopefully enhance your ability to beat up and surpass your fellow teammates!   
</p>

<p>	
Week 6 is comming quickly so start thinking about what you want to pick!   
</p>

<p>
Good luck to all!
