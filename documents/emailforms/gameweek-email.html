Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
It is that time again - the beginning of a NFL Game week! Make sure to get your picks in. Last week was another crazy week with lots of high scoring. There was also some movement in the leader board! Good going Archie (David Archuleta) who made his way up to second (tied with Wildcat Wonder).
