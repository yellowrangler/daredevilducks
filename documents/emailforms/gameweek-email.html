Ahhh Karma! As ususal the NFL is Entertaining in so many ways. More movement on the leader board as NFL Amateur and Wildcat Wonder have leapfroged Archie. The stats are below:

We had an Ooops moment this week when a change was introduced to the website that prevented picks for week 7 to be made! That has been rectified - so please check your picks if you made any to insure that they are still there.

Week 7 is upon us so start thinking about what you want to pick!
