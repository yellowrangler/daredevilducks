Hi <span style='color:teal;'>All Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>
I have been remiss in not getting this end of season email out to our loyal Daredevil Ducks fraternity! This has been another special year. First we increased our membership from the previous year. Second, we were able to add more fun stuff to entertain and inform our members for game picking decision making. And Third, this was a tremendous football year culminating with a great Super bowl. 
</p>

<p>
What a great game! The two best teams in the NFL had at it. The game went back and forth. The San Fransisco 49ers had the lead but could not hold on. In the end the much hyped Mahomes did what his Kansas fans prayed he would do - led his team to their biggest win in his young career. A great Super Bowl. 
</p> 
<p>
This years <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Wins Leader</span> and Daredevil Ducks Champion is <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Team Remington</span> with 184 wins. Congratulations <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Team Remington</span> you are now members of a very small but very important fraternity. There will be trophies and pictures added later!
</p>

<p>
Thank you all again for your participation! We at Daredevil Ducks hope you enjoyed this year as much as we did. We plan on being back next year with hopefully more fun stuff. 
</p>

Sincerely,

<br /><br />
