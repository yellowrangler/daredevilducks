</p>

<div style='padding-top:25px;font-size:16px; font-style: normal;color:black;'>

Hi <span style='color:teal;'>All Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>
I have been remiss in not getting this end of season email out to our loyal Daredevil Ducks fraternity! This has been a special year for a number of reasons. First we doubled our membership from the previous year. Second, we were able to add more fun stuff to entertain and inform our members for game picking decision making. Third,  this was a most impressive football year culminating with perhaps the greatest Super bowl comeback ever. And Fourth, even more improbable, we had last year's Daredevil Ducks champion repeat! Unheard of! 
</p>

<p>
Some have suggested that skulduggery was involved! As a result, we have reached out to Roger Goodell and asked that an investigation be initiated leveraging an impartial and fair process so that we can get to the bottom of all this! After all, the integrity of our Daredevil Ducks league is at stake.  Unfortunately, we have not yet heard back from the commish, but we will keep you all informed if that changes. Roger that!
</p>

<p>
This years <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Wins Leader</span> and Daredevil Ducks Champion is Toothfairy with 187 wins. Congratulation Sabrina you are a most amazing person. There will be trophy's and pictures added later!
</p>

<p>
This years <span style='font-weight:bold; color:blue;'>Total Percentage Leader</span> is Johor Tigress with 72.2%. Congratulation Caroline. Johor Tigress came late in the season so she never had a shot at the title! But that is an impressive percentage, beating our Champion by 2 percentage points. Hopefully, Johor Tigress will join us next year!
</p>

<p>
Thank you all again for your participation! We at Daredevil Ducks hope you enjoyed this year as much as we did. We plan on being back next year with hopefully more fun stuff. 
</p>

Sincerely,

<br /><br />

AirDreamer [Tarry Cutler] and Wildcat Wonder [Tammy Jamieson]
