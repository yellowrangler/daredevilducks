This is your official introduction to our Daredevil Ducks football pool. We would love to have an Avatar for you. An Avatar is a picture or image that people use to represent themselves in our website. Mine is an Airstream to go with my screen name AirDreamer, Tammy's is taken from a WW II bomber decal of a woman riding a bomb for her name Wildcat Wonder - you get the idea! Its all for fun. Tammy says she is working on one for you, so expect to see some examples to choose from soon! The week you picked (4th week into the NFL regular season), you placed second with 11 wins! Not bad! So this is how it works; A football week starts on Thursday night and ends on Monday night. We have your picks for tonight (Thursday), so you still need to make picks for Sunday and Monday night. There are directions on how to do this contained in this email. If you have any questions you can call me at 781-342-0204.
