Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
Another good win for the Patriots. The Bengals are a tough defensive group. A lot of chippieness especially at the end - but hopefully no harm done. So its on to Pittsburgh! 
</p>

<p>
The Chargers Broncos game was a real nail-biter. The Chargers always seem to find a way to lose in the 4th quarter. And it seemed like that was going to happen again. But no - the Chargers persevered!  A great game if you were a Chargers fan. 
</p>

<p>
A bad day for Steeler fans as big Ben went down with a meniscus tear. Only time will tell when or if he will make it back for this season. Still, the Steelers have plenty of fire power so we shall have to wait and see.
</p>

<p>
What is up with those crazy Chiefs; they win, they loose - repeat! They beat up the good looking kid on the block (Oakland) quite handily.  I never know which team is going to show up with either of these teams. 
</p>

<p>
The Falcons Seahawks was a good game marred by bad officiating. Is it just me or is the league unable to be anything even near consistent - especially with anything to do with pass interference. Atlanta got victimized by a terrible call at the end of the game. Doesn't mean Atlanta would have won, But.....
</p>

<p>
The Texans Colts game was a late night snooze for the first 3 quarters. Not a good looking game up to that point. I confess that I went to bed expecting to see a Colt victory in the morning. Woof! For those Texan fans who put the time in and stayed up - You got your reward!
</p>

<p>
All in all a good/bizarre week.
</p>

<p>
