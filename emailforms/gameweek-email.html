Daredevil Ducks - Week 9 Review with Week 10 ahead!

<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:black;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
This was the first week that EVERYONE sent in a pick! Thank you ALL for your participation. This is a League where more is always Merrier! I hope you all are having as much fun playing as we are in running the League!
</p>
<p>
This was a week to be contrarian. I mean who would have picked the Titans, Colts and San Fransisco 49ers. Well 7 of you did, and hopefully that propelled you towards the winners circle. The Steelers lost big Ben (again), and the Patriots lost Dion Lewis for the season. Tough week. The Bengals and Carolina continue to prove me wrong, and Peyton Manning was exposed as being human after all. The Cowboys vs Eagles game was a nail biter, and Philip Rivers continues to be the best that never was (at least in my book). All in all, it was very entertaining. But there is still sooo much more to come!
</p>

<p>
We have made more changes to the Daredevil Ducks Website. They are as follows:

<ol>
	<li>You can now update your own personal information by clicking on your Avatar at the top right of the website. This will allow you to: 
		<ul>
			<li>Change all personal information but your avatar. You still need to do that through us. But we are working on that.</li>
			<li>You can now select your <span style='font-weight:bold; color:teal;'>Favorite Team</span>. This selection currently will be used when you go to the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Team Weekly Ranking</span> screen. It will preselect YOUR Favorite team from the list of teams.</li>
			<li>You can add a little about yourself in the new field <span style='font-weight:bold; color:teal;'>Biography</span>. 
			</li>
			<li>There is also a check box for <span style='font-weight:bold; color:teal;'>Please no eMail's</span>. It is for future use.</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>We made a change to the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Team Weekly Ranking</span> screen. There is now a sort button under the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:teal;'>Week</span> column heading. Click on this, and it will toggle sorting the information.</li> 
	<li>All NFL Team web sites are now accessible in <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Team Discovery</span>. You can still access any team's website by clicking on their NFL logo.</li>
	<li>The <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Hall of Fame</span> screen now shows a vacant spot for the Dare Devil Ducks 2015 winner! Remember this could be YOU!</li>
	<li>We moved all the selection lists down a line to make these screens more useable on smaller devices.</li>
	<li>All the NFL Icons were re-mastered to be more scaleable and cleaner.</li>
	<li>We continue to make overall improvements for a better user experience on smaller devices. Still lots of work to be done here as this is designed to be primarily a desktop application.</li>
</ol> 
<br />
Please let us know if you have any questions.
