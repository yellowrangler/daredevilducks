Daredevil Ducks - Week 8 Review and Week 9 ahead!

<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:black;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
Another great week for games. The Raiders look like they have found their mojo. The Broncos and Manning showed that they are not the old man team by putting a worthy smack down on the seemingly unbeatable Packers. The poor Lions look just miserable as they got taken out to the wood shed by the Chiefs in jolly old England. All in all, it was entertaining. But there is sooo much more to come!

<p>
We have added a new screen called <span style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Team Weekly Ranking</span> under the Teams menu. <p>This Information displays the Rankings for the team selected, for each week.The Power Rankings are determined by ESPN's Power Panel (group of 80+ Writers, Editors & TV Personalities) prior to the weekâ€™s games.</p>

<p>Offensive Rankings are based on the highest to lowest Average of Yards Gained by each Team. Defensive Rankings are based on the lowest to highest Average of Yards Gained by the Team's Opponents. The Offensive & Defensive Statistical Data is provided by SportsDirect Inc. via Team Rankings, LLC .  They are for the previous week's game.</p>  

<p>Hopefully this gives you a better idea of how to select the winning team for each game. You can see a more detailed explanation if you click on the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Click me to Show Information for Weekly Ranking</span>. Please let us know if you have any questions.

<p>This week brought no movement to the Leader Board as Wildcat Wonder, Peanuts and Toothfairy have fought off and retained their current leadership status. The Total Percentages Leader Board finds Skinny pushed back into third by a determined Exploding Brain! Way to go Steve. Of course the best part of the week was yours truely hitting the highwater mark on the weeks picks with a 13 and 1 record. Followed closely by Super Brawler who would have tied me, but decided at the last minute to pick the Packers. Ouch! The stats are below:
