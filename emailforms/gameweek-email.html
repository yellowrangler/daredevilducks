Daredevil Ducks - Week 13 Review with Week 14 ahead!

<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:black;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
A crazy week of football.  This week saw the Detroit Lions loose in what had to be gut wrenching fashion. I thought the last second facemask call on the Lions was ticky tacky and should not have been made. Especially given that during the Hail Mary pass, I would swear I saw numerous interference infractions on both sides occurring in the endzone. 
</p>
<p>
Carolina gave all it's supporters a scare in their game with the Saints; waiting to rip out the heart of the New Orleans fans at the end. New England lost it's second game; but still put the fear of Goodell in the Eagles on their final drive.  There have been a lot of great last minute winners this season. Making it hard on some of us who need sleep to sneak off early. The Bengals and Steelers are beginning to find their mojo. It's a pity they are in the same division. The Redskins showed me they cant win the games they have to. Against a depleted Dallas team in Washington they lost. So instead of owning first place and being in charge of their destiny; they have fallen into a three way tie with the Giants and Eagles. Crazy stuff!

This week brought another re-configuration to the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Games Won Leader</span> Board as Archie continues his relentless pursuit of first place. Toothfairy has sole position of first place to herself. Wildcat Wonder has secured second; with Archie and Peanuts tied for third.  The <span style='font-weight:bold; color:blue;'>Total Percentages Leader</span> Board continues to reflect the Leader Board for the top three. The best picker for <span style='font-weight:bold; color:green;'>Player Weekly Totals</span> was a three way tie with AirDreamer, Archie and SandyLand (Roll Tide Roll). Way to go folks! The stats are below:
