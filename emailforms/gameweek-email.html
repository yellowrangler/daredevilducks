<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:black;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
A sad day for Patriot nation as the boys took it in the teeth. Nothing worked for the Pats; and the Bills get to gloat at least for this week. It will be good to get Tom Brady back! 
</p>

<p>
The Bengals pummeled the fins. The Panthers lost again. The Raiders won in spectacular fashion against the Ravens. The Rams beat the poor Cardinals who have dropped to 1 and 3! The Steelers came back with a resounding win against the Chiefs. And the Vikings took out the Giants in what is shaping up as a very good Viking team. All in all a good week.
</p>

<p>
We had another great turnout this week. Thank you all again for participating. NFL Amateur and Scotsman357 now command sole  first place on the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Games Won Leader</span> board! They are followed by 18 Wheeler and Kathie (with others) in second place. 
</p>
<p>
Red Gorillaz has taken command of first place (100%) of the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:blue;'>Total Percentage Leader</span> Board. He is followed by Snow Storm and Scotsman357.
</p>
<p>
For <span style='font-weight:bold; color:#228b22;'>Player Weekly Totals</span> bragging rights we have 18 Wheeler in first place followed by Scotsman357 and Snow Storm tied in second. Way to go folks. The stats are below. Read em and weep (I know I do)!

For those of you adventerous souls teathered to mobile phones, we have created a mobile version of dare devile ducks. This is what we call a beta version. Translation - It may not work as well as our main website. It is meant to accomodate the smaller screens on a phone. I would love feedback from folks either positive or negative if you use it.
