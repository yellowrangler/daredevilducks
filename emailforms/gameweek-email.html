Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
We hope everyone had a Merry Christmas! We are in the home stretch with only this and the next week left before the playoffs kick in! We have made some more improvements in the website. We have added <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Playoff Brackets</span> and  <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>NFL Headlines</span> under <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Teams</span>. There are playoff brackets for both the 2014 and 2015 seasons. We will be making changes to the 2015 brackets as warrented by changes in the next two weeks! The NFL Headlines will show last minute news regarding games and plyers (from Fox News). We hope you enjoy these additions.
</p>

This will be a short weekly email as we have already had our thursday night game. Please remember to pick and thank you all for being part of this years incarnation of Dare Devil Ducks!
