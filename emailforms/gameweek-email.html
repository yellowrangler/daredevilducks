Daredevil Ducks - Week 12 Review with Week 13 ahead!

<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:black;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
What a week of football. Is it me, or has officiating fallen to a new low. And I am not just ranting regarding calls on my Patriots. ALL games seem to share some form of silly officiating (this is a family site - so I will keep it clean). 
</p>
<p>
Anyways.... This week saw the Detroit Lions roaring back. Carolina continues it's pursuit of a perfect season. Chicago (and Cutler), continue to impress me - long way to go though. As for the Colts; who needs Luck when you have a 40 year old Hasselbeck who just keeps winning! The new York Giants continue to implode while the Washingto Redskins under Jay Gruden's tutilage continue to suprise. Both Seattle and Baltimore had last second thrillers. Fun stuff!

Today we are unvieling our NEW <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Pick Your Teams</span> web page. The radio buttons are gone! To select a team click on the TEAM NAME. Clicking on the team name turns the select team area red. Additionally we added a quick way to view stats for the two teams palaying each other. On this screen only, click on the teams icon (that is the image next to the team name) and a window will pop up with the current stats for the two teams playing. On the popup window, clicking on the team icon will take you to the teams web site as before. Please try it and let us know what you think! We are always looking for ways to improve your picking experience. If you have any questions or suggestionsplease feel free to reach out to us.

This week brought a re-configuration to the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Games Won Leader</span> Board as Toothfairy (Way to go Sabrina!) has leapfroged Peanuts to be in a first place tie with her Auntie Wildcat Wonder. The <span style='font-weight:bold; color:blue;'>Total Percentages Leader</span> Board now perfectly reflects th eLeader Board for the top 3. The best picker for <span style='font-weight:bold; color:green;'>Player Weekly Totals</span> was a 3 way tie with Archie (Nice going David), NFL Amateur and Toothfairy. Way to go folks! The stats are below:
