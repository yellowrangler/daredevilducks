Daredevil Ducks - Week 10 Review with Week 11 ahead!

<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:black;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
The week was marred by the unprovoked attacks of ISIS on people just like us, out on the night having a little fun. Please take some time and pray for the victums and their families.
</p>
<p>
This was another week to be contrarian. The Dolphins, Lions, Jaguars, Bears, Chiefs and Texans are all eveidnce that on any given night anyone can win! No one picked the Chiefs and only 1 player picked the Texans. The Patriots won but also lost Eddleman for possibly the season. The Bengals offence completely unraveled in their game with the Texans, and for the first time that I can recall, Peyton Manning was benched. I had to wear sunglasses for the Jets Bills game; I mean what's up with those uniforms. And what about Rex Ryan making IK Enemkpali captain for the game against the Jets! You all remember IK Enemkpali, he was the Jets player that punched the then Jets starting quarterback Geno Smith in the face, earnig him a dismissial. Man you can't make this stuff up!
</p>

This week again brought no movement to the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Games Won Leader</span> Board as Wildcat Wonder, Peanuts and Toothfairy have fought off and continue to retain their current leadership status. The <span style='font-weight:bold; color:blue;'>Total Percentages Leader</span> Board finds Toothfairy jumping over Scotsman357 and into 2nd place tie with Peanuts! Nice going Sabrina! The best picker for <span style='font-weight:bold; color:green;'>Player Weekly Totals</span> was Super Brawler, followed closely by 4Horsemen and ANTIC. Way to go folks! The stats are below:
