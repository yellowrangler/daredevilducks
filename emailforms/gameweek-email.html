Daredevil Ducks - Playoffs! Week 19 Review Week 20 Ahead!

<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:black;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
Week 19 again shows why the NFL is the game to watch! 
</p>
<p>
The Pats took care of business by dispatching the Chiefs. It was good to see Edelman back on the field. Arizona squeaked by the Green Bay Packers whose string of unbelievable comebacks was finally brought to an end. It took an overtime to finish the Pack off; with the obligatory broken play for large yardage to Fitzgerald. A great and entertaining game. 
</p>
<p>
Carolina beat the Seahawks stupid in the first half; only to have the Seahawks come roaring back in the second. Alas, Seattle finally ran out of miracles, ultimately ceding the game to Carolina. Pittsburg had the game. In a play eerily reminiscent of Hill's fumble in Cincinnati (karma?), the usually playoff savy Steelers turned the ball over in what would become the winning points for the Broncos. Tough loss. I would have liked to have seen a Pats Steelers playoff. Two tough teams that don't like each other! Not that there is any love lost between the Patriots and Broncos...
