Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
It has been a great second week for football! 
</p>
<p>
It is still early; but there were still some suprises. The Vikings have come out hot, leading their division and doing so by beating their nemesis Green Bay Packers. After winning in spectatacular fashion last week; the Raiders lost to the seemingly lowly Atlanta Falcons. The Dolphins continue to improve on the art of loosing; and the Bills - well let's just say the the Ryan brothers look more like the Three stooges minus one. On the other hand the Pittsburg Steelers have come roaring out and appear to be one of the top teams this year, as do the Texans, Broncos and Patriots. But like I said - it's still VERY EARLY. 
</p>

<p>
We had a great turnout this week. Thank you all for participating. NFL Amateur is in sole command of first place (by 2 games) on the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Games Won Leader</span> board! She is followed by Toothfairy and Scotsman357. 
</p>
<p>
CarolineD has emerged from out of the pack to command first place (100%) of the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:blue;'>Total Percentage Leader</span> Board. She is followed by NFL Amature and Toothfairy.
</p>
<p>
For <span style='font-weight:bold; color:#228b22;'>Player Weekly Totals</span> bragging rights we have NFL Amateur toping the list with 14 wins!, Holy smoke - that is remarkable! She is followed by Scotsman356 and Steel Got a Chance. Way to go folks. Thats what I like about this game. So many levels to be da man (or woman). The stats are below. Read em and weep (I know I do)!
