Hi <span style='color:teal;'> Dare Devil Ducks Members</span>,

<br />

<p>
It has been 5 years since we started the Dare Devil Ducks Football League. In that time our product has transitioned from a spreadsheet with 6 members to the web and mobile presence we have today with over 70 members. 
</p>

<p>
In that time we have worked continuously to enhance and improve our service to our members. As we look back, we realize that much of the functionality and many of the these changes may have not been successfully communicated to all our members. Nor do we know which parts of our web and mobile services are embraced and which are ignored.
</p>

<p>
 We are constantly trying to make our league more fun with the information you need to make winning picks each week.  We are working to improve the website, and add valued features to the make each of you better players.  Thus in an effort to better understand what you like, and what you would like to see going forward, we would appreciate it if you would take 15-20 minutes to complete the survey. 	
</p>

<p>
Each question requests a "Yes" or "No" answer, with an option to comment further.  There may also be some features, stats and displays that you will learn about as you complete this survey.
