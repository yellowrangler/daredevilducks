Hi <span style='color:teal;'> Dare Devil Ducks Members</span>,

<br />

<p>
It has been 5 years since we started the Dare Devil Ducks Football League. In that time our product has transitioned from a spreadsheet with 6 members to the web and mobile presence we have today with over 70 members. 
</p>

<p>
In that time we have worked continuously to enhance and improve our service to our members. As we look back, we realize that much of the functionality and many of the these changes may have not been successfully communicated to all our members. Nor do we know which parts of our web and mobile services are embraced and which are ignored.
</p>
 
<p>
As a result, we are now reaching out to all our members and asking them to take our Dare Devil Ducks Survey. The survey results will help guide us for future updates with the goal of providing all our members with a clearer and easier user experience.
</p>
 
<p>
You must be logged in to take the survey.
