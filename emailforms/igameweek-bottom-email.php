<span  style='font-weight:bold;color:#228B22;'>May you all have a Merry Christmas!</span>
</p>

<p>
To keep in the Holiday spirit we have added a Christmas tree at the bottom of the website that when clicked will start snow falling. If clicked again it will turn off the snow! 
</p>

<p>
For your Mobile devices simply use your thumb and swipe right to left at the bottom of the page where your Avatar is. And behold the Christmas tree will appear.
