<span  style='font-weight:bold; color:red;'>Delete your Daredevil Ducks web page</span>
</p>

<p>
We have made a couple of changes that you should be aware of. You will need to delete your current version of daredevil ducks. You can do this by closing the browser or closing the tab. You may also need to clear your browser cache. If you are not sure on how to do this please contact me and I will walk you through it. You will know you need to do this if you are not able to get to the Player Stats!

</p>

<p>
The Player stats now has 3 selections -  Total Wins Leaders, Total Percentage Leaders, and Weekly Total Leaders, We broke the total wins and total percentage wins out from the Leader Board page inter their own pages.

<p>
<span  style='font-weight:bold;color:green;'>We have added Player Groups</span>
</p>

<p>
The Player stats selections -  Total Wins Leaders, Total Percentage Leaders, and Weekly Total Leaders, now has a dropdown selection called Player Groups. These groups represent a number of players. If selected, only the information for those players is returned and ranked. A great way to see how you compare to your friends, family etc! We added a few groups so that you can see how it works. But if you want to have a group of your own - send me the group name and its members and I will set it up for you.
