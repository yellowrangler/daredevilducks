Dare Devil Ducks IP Change
<div style='font-size:15px; font-style: normal; color:maroon;'>

<br />

Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
We have had an IP address change. This will happen from time to time as we do not have a dedicated IP address from Verizon. So every now and then either Verizon will re-issue us a new IP address, or our router will loose it's connection with Verizon which results in a new IP address! 
</p>

<p>
What this means to you is that you must restart your Daredevil ducks web page by typing in http://daredevilducks.xyz for computers or http://yellowrangler.com for mobile devices!

<p>
Sorry for the inconvienience,
