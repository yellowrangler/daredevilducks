Hi <span style='color:teal;'>All Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>
We had an oops moment. We discovered that there was a problem with updating your player profile information. Worst part was that Wildcat Wonder discovered the faux pas when she tried to add her favorite team! 
</p>

<p>
The problem has been fixed. So you may need to go back and re-enter any profile changes you made. 
</p>

<p>
Yours,
</p>
