Hi <span style='color:teal;'>Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>
Just a friendly reminder! If you are receiving this email, it is because you have outstanding picks for the week. If you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. Apologies to Ben Franklin from whom this quote is derived. Don't be that "other" guy or girl. Make your pick!
</p>

<p>
You can send me the picks via email if you are having trouble using the website.
