This is your official introduction to our Daredevil Ducks football site. You have a default screen name (Janet Hepner) and a default Avatar. We need you to come up with ones of your own. Tammy and I created this league to have fun with a few friends. It has blossomed nicely into a larger group. But the emphasis on fun and friends has never changed. We hope you have fun too Janet, Please feel free to contact either of us if you have any questions. We send out emails  a couple of days before games so be on the lookout!
</p>

<p>
First thing you need to do, is to pick a fun Screen Name. It can be something to do with football, like Tammy's "Wildcat Wonder", based on the wildcat running play.  Or a name of something that you like; like Tarry's "AirDreamer" based on his love for Airstream Trailers.  Or it could be something to do with your career, like Sabrina's "ToothFairy", based on her Dental Hygiene career.  It's really up to you. 
</p>

<p>
Once you pick your Screen Name, we need to get an image that helps depict your Screen Name.  We can help find a fun Icon/image if you would like.  
</p>

<p>
So this is how it works; A football week starts on Thursday night and ends on Monday night. So go to Pick games and start picking and having fun!
