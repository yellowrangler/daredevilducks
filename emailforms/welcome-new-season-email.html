<p>
<span style="font-size:16px;font-style:normal;font-weight:bold;color:#6C0000;">Welcome to the Daredevil Ducks Football League 2019 Season!</span>
</p>

<div style='padding-top:25px;font-size:16px; font-style: normal;color:black;'>

Hi <span style='color:teal;'>All Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>
It is the beginning of another exciting new season of Daredevil Ducks football! It seems like only yesterday that we were crowning Don O'Malley (4Horsemen) as our 2018 Daredevil Ducks Champion! This is shaping up to be a tremendous season. Lots of good teams out there will be looking to unseat the current Super Bowl Champ Patriots.</p>

<p>A lot has happened with Daredevil Ducks. We have completely refined our codebase. We published our first Survey, designed by Wildcat Wonder, to try and help us understand our members likes and dislikes. If you have not started or finished the survey, please do so! It will ultimately help all of us moving forward. The survey can be accessed by clicking on the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:#FF6E3B;'>New</span> <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Survey</span> menu and selecting <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Take Survey</span>. You can see the results of our survey by selecting <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Survey Results</span>.</p>

<p>We have started rolling out our new <span style='font-weight:bold; color:#FF6E3B;'>Help System</span>. Currently it is only available on the following pages (desktop only):</p>

<div style="padding-top:10px;padding-left:35px;">

The help icon will always be displayed on the far right across from the page title. The icon appears as <span style='font-weight:bold; color:#FF6E3B;'>Donald Ducks head</span>. Clicking on the help icon will take you to the complementary <span style='font-weight:bold; color:#FF6E3B;'>Help page</span>.
