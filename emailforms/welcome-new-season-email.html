Hi <span style='color:teal;'>All Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>
Last year the Rams won the Super Bowl against the upstart Bengals! But now the competition starts anew. All teams are poised at the starting line looking to make this year their dream year. Who will it be? 
</p>

<p>
And which one of our Dare Devilducks members will have the savvy and brains to take the crown!  Last year <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Hygenius</span> took the 'Crown'! But it is a new year, so all are potential Daredevil Duck champions! So lets put on our favorite teams clothing and have some fun! After all that is what Dare Devilducks is all about!
