Welcome back all Daredevil Ducks members. Last year <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>The Juice is Loose</span> won our coveted <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'> Daredevil Ducks Championship Trophy</span>. But 2025 is a reset for our members as well. So Ladies and Gentlmen (can we still say that? Ha Ha) sharpen your pencils, dust off your Ouija boards and go find your favorite lucky charms! This is your chance to win it all.

  All in all it looks like we are in for an entertaining season!
