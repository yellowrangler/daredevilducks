Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
We have added a screen and renamed another. Under the button <span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>Games</span> the second item is now called <span style='color:black;font-weight:bold;'>Each Player's picks for week</span>. It is the same functionality as before (you can use this selection to see the picks of any player by selecting the player, season and week). 
</p>

<p>
The third item under the button <span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>Games</span> is now <span style='color:black;font-weight:bold;'>Players Picks for Week by Team</span>. This selection lists a week's games with the number of player picks for each team displayed. This is a great way to see what teams are getting the most picks for a week! 
</p>

<p>
<span style='color:maroon;font-weight:bold;'>Example:</span> Go to <span style='color:green;font-weight:bold;'>Games</span> and select <span style='color:black;font-weight:bold;'>Players Picks for Week by Team</span>. Select <span style='color:teal;font-weight:bold;'>Season: 2015</span> and <span style='color:teal;font-weight:bold;'>Week: 2</span>. Look at the first <span style='color:black;font-weight:bold;'>Game Kansas City Chiefs</span> vs <span style='color:black;font-weight:bold;'>Denver Broncos</span>. From the Picks column you can see that <span style='color:black;font-weight:bold;'>6</span> players picked Kansas and <span style='color:black;font-weight:bold;'>15</span> players picked Denver!
</p>

<p>
You can change the Season and Week by selecting from the provided dropdowns to view different combinations of total picks for seasons and weeks.
