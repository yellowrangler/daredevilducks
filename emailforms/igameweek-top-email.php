  It was a good week of football. 
</p>

<p>
The week started out with the Panthers beating the Falcons. The Buccaneers beat the Seahawks in a thriller across the pond in Germany. In a crazy game, the Vikings defeated the Bills. The Lions eked out a win over the Bears in a back and forth affair. The Chiefs beat the Jaguars. The Dolphins beat the Browns in a game featuring more offense then defense.
</p> 

<p>
The Giants beat the Texans. The Steelers beat the Saints. The Titans beat the Broncos. The Colts with a new coach and newly reinstated Mat Ryan beat the woeful Raiders. The Packers rallied to beat the Cowboys. The Cardinals beat the Stafford-less Rams. The 49ers stayed relevent as they beat the Chargers.

<p>
In the final game of the week the Commanders gave the Eagles their first loss!
</p> 

<p>
  All in all a superb week of football!
</p>
