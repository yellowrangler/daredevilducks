In the first game, The Rams beat the lowly Patriots. The Broncos beat the Panthers, and the Bears beat the Texans. What happened to the Texans this year? The Cowboys beat the Bengals. Green bay eked by the Lions. And the Chiefs came back again against the Dolphins. Arizona beat up on the Giants and the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the Vikings.</p>

<p>
The Colts put big points on the board in their win over the Raiders. The Seahawks beat the still winless Jets and the Chargers beat the Falcons. The Eagles beat the Drew-less Saints and the Washingtons beat the 49ers. In a bit of a surprise, the Bills beat the Steelers giving the Steelers 2 consecutive losses. In the final game, a truly back and fourth contest found the Ravens winning over the Browns as last team scoring.
