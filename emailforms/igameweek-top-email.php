The eigth week of the 2019 season is in the bag. The Daredevil Ducks rankings still continue to churn!
</p> 

<p>
The Vikings beat the Redskins. The Seahawks eased by the Falcons. The Eagles championed the Bills. The Chargers finally got the football gods on their side by beating the Bears. The Bears had the game in hand with seconds left on the clock only to miss a makable field goal.
</p> 

<p>
The Lions beat the struggling Giants. The Texans beat the Raiders in a close contest. The Jaguars shot down the insipid Jets. The Rams beat the Bengals - keeping the Bengals season at a perfect 0 wins. The Saints crushed the Cardinals. The Titans beat the fading Buccaneers. The 49rs beat the Panthers, keeping their perfect record intact. The Colts beat the disappointing Broncos.
</p> 

<p>
The Patriots continued their winning ways by dispatching the Browns in Foxborough. The Packers beat the Mahome-less Chiefs in Kansas. And in the final game, the Steelers beat the winless Dolphins.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
