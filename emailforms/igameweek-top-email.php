<p>Week 4 is in the books!  
</p>	
<p>	
The Patriots did a 180 from last week as they pounded the undefeated Dolphins. They get Edelman back for Tuesday night football, which should also help. But it is is a short week for the Pats so we shall see. The Rams beat the Vikings in a closely fought contest. Atlanta found another way to loose as they fell to the Bengals. The Bears crushed the flailing Buccaneers; sealing the deal to have Winston as next weeks starter. The Cowboys beat the Lions in Dallas. The Packers beat the Bills big time. The Texans got a needed win over the Colts. The Jaguars beat the fading Jets. The Titans, in what has to be considered an upset, beat the Eagles. The Seahawks beat the Cardinals. The Raiders beat the Browns in a close contest. The Chargers beat the 49ers.The Saints pummeled the Giants. The Ravens crushed the Steelers. And in what had to be the game of the week; the Chiefs beat the Broncos.

  All in all a good week of football!
