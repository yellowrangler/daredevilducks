Hi <span style='color:teal;'>Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>
	We are down to the final week! Where has the time gone! The Patriots started out slow but finally took it to the Bills defeating them handily keeping their 1st seed position in the AFC intact. The Ravens beat the Colts keeping them active in the wildcard hunt. The Vikings defeated the Packers solidifying their playoff spot as 2nd seed in the NFC. The Bengals beat the going, going gone Lions. The Chiefs beat the Dolphins positioning the Chiefs as 4th seed AFC. The Browns lost again; this time to the Bears.
</p>

	The Panthers beat the Buccaneers keeping them ensconced in the Wild card hunt. The Saints beat the Falcons in a game where the Falcon's looked awful. The Redskin's crushed the Broncos. The Rams squeaked by the Titan's and the Chargers beat the Jet's. In a surprise the 49ers beat the Jaguars. And the Seahawks beat the Cowboys; bouncing the Cowboys from the playoffs and revitalizing the Seahawks chances. The Cardinals bludgeoned the Giants and the Steelers beat the Texans. In the final game the Eagles held on to beat the Raiders, preserving the Eagles first seed in the NFC.
