  It was a good week of football. 
</p>

<p>
The week started out with the Eagles continuing their perfect season by beating the Texans in Houston. The Chargers eeked by the Falcons. The Dolphins beat the Bears in similar fashion. The Bengals crushed the Panthers. In a bit of an upset, the Lions beat the Packers. The Jaguars beat the just plain awful Raiders. The Patriots beat the Colts in a snooze fest. 
</p> 

<p>
In another upset, the Jets beat the Bills. The Vikings beat the Commanders. Seattle continues to impress as does Geno Smith, as they beat the Cardinals. Tampa Bay came back with a classic Tom Brady one minute drill to beat the Rams. The Chiefs beat the Titans in overtime.
</p> 

<p>
In the final game of the week the Ravens beat the Saints in New Orleans!
</p> 

<p>
  All in all a superb week of football!
</p>
