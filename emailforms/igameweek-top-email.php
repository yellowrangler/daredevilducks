Hi <span style='color:teal;'>Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>Dillie Dillie!

	After you think you have seen it all - it happens again. What a tremendous game. Jacksonville started out looking unstoppable; moving the ball seemingly at will down the field while stifling the Patriots offense. The Patriots first and last drives would provide them with all their first half points - 10. Meanwhile, the Jaguars put 14 points on the board. But the Patriots could not find the end zone in the third quarter while the Jaguars would add 2 more field goals to go up by 10 points (20 to 10). So there it was, less then 15 minutes left in the game, Gronk gone due to the concussion protocol, Brady with 10 stitches in his THROWING hand, a Patriots defense that wasn't stopping anyone - it looked bad. But Brady drove the offense down the field twice for 2 touchdowns while the defense shutdown the Jaguars until next year. Classic Patriots come back. Next for the Patriots is Philadelphia at the Super Bowl!

	The Philadelphia Eagles came into their house as underdogs hosting the Vikings. The Eagles offense, without their starting quarterback looked anemic at best in their win over the Falcons putting up only 17 points. This time they came locked and loaded. Foles lead his Eagles to 38 points and did so with great poise. Meanwhile, the Eagles defense held the Vikings to 7 points. This is a team with a large chip on their shoulder. They will meet the Patriots at the Super Bowl. What a great story.
