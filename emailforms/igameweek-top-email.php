Hi <span style='color:teal;'>Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>
	The first game of the playoff season has been played! 
</p>	
<p>	
	The Titans beat the Chiefs in a thrilling game that showcased the Chiefs in the first half and then the Titans in the second. This was a game that was either going to show the world that the Titans are for real or that the Kansas City Chiefs were in fact the team that beat the stuffing out of the Patriots at the beginning of the season. This was a bad game for the Chiefs and I suspect a fatal game for Andy Reed. A very likable guy that just hasn't been able to get his team to show up on the field. But hats off to the Titans. In the end they did what they needed to do! Next step for them will be the Patriots.
</p>
<p>
	The Falcons beat the Rams in another competitive matchup. The officials let the boys play, as there were numerous defensive holds that this viewer saw. This was a great game for the Atalanta defense as they handcuffed the vaunted Rams, holding them to 13 points. The Falcons look like a team on a mission! Good luck to them! They face the Wentz-less Eagles next.
</p>
<p>	
	The Jaguars beat the Bills in what started out as a snoozer. Many who left that game missed out on an exciting finish. The Jaguars defense looked much better in the second half. Bortles had a tough go at it in much of the game, but was able to do enough to win. The Jaguars face the Steelers next!
</p>
<p>
	The Saints held on to beat the Panthers in a very close and entertaining matchup. This was a hard hitting game worthy of both teams. It took a late sack of Cam to finally put the nail on the proverbial game coffin. It was a great game to watch. The Saints move on to play the Vikings next! 
</p>
