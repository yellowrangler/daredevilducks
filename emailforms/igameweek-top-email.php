Hi <span style='color:teal;'>Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

<br />

<p>Wow!  
</p>	
<p>	
	The field was cold and the winter wind was running through players uniforms like Sherman through Atlanta. The Patriots came out cautiously against the Titan's, giving up an early lead. But Brady started to find his receivers and the defense started to put the kabash on the Titans offense. And before you knew it the Pats had put 21 points up on the Titans. And they never looked back. Not the greatest game, but a very well disciplined one AND a game that featured a number of sacks on Mariota. The road to the AFC title continues to go through New England. Next up - Jacksonville! 
</p>
<p>
	The Falcons came out tentatively and just never looked comfortable! The Atlanta scoring juggxrnaught was effectively squashed by the Eagles defense. Nick Foles played well enough to win. But this viewer is not convinced he can score points. Next for the Eagles is the Vikings!
</p>
<p>	
	The Jaguars Steelers game was one for the books. The theme for the game went something like this - the Jaguars scored a lot and then the Steelers caught up on scintillating deep throws. Back and forth the two Goliaths beat each other. In the end some dubious play calling put the Steelers behind the 8 ball. A botched on sides kick opened up a killer field goal that the Steelers could not overcome as they ran out of time and luck. The Jaguars Next opponent is the New England Patriots. 
</p>
<p>
	The Saints Vikings game was another crazy exciting affair. The Vikings looked stronger early on. But the Saints caught up in the fourth quarter. And what a quarter! The Saints had just put the finishing touches on a touchdown seemingly cinching the game. Ah but there was still time on the clock and fairy dust in the air. The Vikings got the ball on the 25 with 25 seconds on the clock. An offensive penalty cost them 5 yards to the 20. Then 2 incomplete passes. Third and long! With 10 seconds left in the game, Keenum dropped a perfect pass to Diggs who dodged the Saints safety and ran in for the winning touchdown. I love this stuff! Next for the Saints is Philadelphia!
