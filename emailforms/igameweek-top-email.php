The week started out with the Bills beating the snot out of the Patriots. The Steelers played well enough to beat the Falcons in Atlanta. The Packers held court over the Bears. The Lions, no longer the league doormat, beat the Jaguars. The Browns with Deshaun Watson beat the Texans in Houston. The Vikings improved their winning ways with a win over the Jets.

The Giants and the Commanders played to a tie. The Eagles crushed the Titans. The Ravens with an injured Lamar Jackson, brought in Tyler Huntley to beat the Broncos. The Seahawks beat the Rams. The 49ers lost Garoppolo to a broken leg. No problem, rookie quarterback Brock Purdy took the reigns as the 49ers beat the Dolphins. The Bengals beat the Chiefs. The Raiders beat the Chargers. The Cowboys roped and tied the Colts.

In the final game of the week Tom Brady showed even his naysayers why he is the G.O.A.T.; as the Buccaneers came from behind to beat the Saints!
