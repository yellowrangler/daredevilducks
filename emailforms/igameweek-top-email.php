Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
The playoff gods have spoken! This week was not as competative as one would have hoped. Most games were a statement making beatdown. 
</p>

<p>
The Car-less Raiders just could not get into gear to beat a very animic Texas team. The only person on the Lions team who showed up was the quaterback. Though there were some crucial questionable calls that went Seattle's way in that game (4th down scoring fasemask anyone?). The Steelers looked VERY scarey as they pumled the Dolphins. Elli Manning saw his heralded (well tanned - Ha) recievers unable to make big plays even when the ball hit them squarely on the hands. Rogers had no such problem - as the Packers quietly dispathched the Giants.
</p>

<p>
So now the real fun begins. Time for the cream of the NFL to get churned! Wildcat Wonder is working on the updated brackets as I write this. Same format next week - 2 games on Saturday and 2 games on Sunday.</p>

<p>
We had another great turnout this week. Thank you all again for participating. We have a 3 way tie as 18 Wheeler,  Toothfairy and Wildcat Wonder share first place on the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Games Won Leader</span> board!
