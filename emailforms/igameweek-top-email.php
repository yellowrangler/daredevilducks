This week got started with the Panthers putting a bag of hurt on the Texans! Not exactly a page turner.
</p>

<p>
The Titans beat the winless Colts. In a match of two 0 and 3 teams, the Falcons further humiliated the Giants in a close and somewhat boring game. In something of an upset, the Chargers beat the overly hyped Chiefs. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh, which is bad news for Steeler fans, as these two are division rivals. The Browns continued to impress in their win over the Bears. The Lions lost in a heart breaker to the Ravens. The Lions had just come roaring (Lion roaring - cleaver yes?) back leading by 1, with almost no time on the clock. The Ravens were able to bring the ball to the 49 yard line representing a 66 yard field goal attempt. The field goal kicker hit the cross bar and the ball popped into the air and through giving the Ravens the win and setting a new record for the longest field goal!

The Saints beat the inconsistent Patriots in Foxborough. The Cardinals thumped the Jaguars. This game featured a 68 yard field goal attempt by the Cardinals that was run back for a touchdown by the Jaguars tieing the NFL record for longest return for touchdown. The Bills stampeded the Washingtons. The Broncos continued their quest for a perfect season by beating the hapless Jets. In a closely played match, the Raiders squeaked by the Dolphins. The Vikings beat the Seahawks, and the Rams beat the Buccaneers! The Packers came back in a thrilling ending to the Sunday night game, beating the 49ers by 2 with a last second field goal!

In the last game of the week, the Cowboys got their second win by bludgeoning the Eagles!
