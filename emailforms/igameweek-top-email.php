In Sundays Conference games - The <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Eagles</span> crushed the <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Commanders</span> in a lopsided affair. The <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Chiefs</span> beat the <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Bills</span> in a game that was not as close as the score. Very disappointing game for Bills fans!
