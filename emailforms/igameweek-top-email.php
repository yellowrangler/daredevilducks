This was a curious week indeed. The Broncos were made to play without a quarterback, yet the Steelers and Ravens were permitted to push their match not once but three times to suit their covid issues! Doesn't seem like a level application of fairness and balance to me. What do you out there think? Remember the old days when you had a schedule and you were required to field the game with what players you had? Regardless of snow, rain, aliens or covid? Roger that!

Our clearly incompetent IT staff did not envision Tuesday or Wednesday games. As a result, any games on those days will appear as very late Monday night games. So make sure you get those games selected on time.

In the first game, the Lions lost to the Texans and in so doing lost Patricia's job as head coach. The Washingtons beat the beastly Cowboys. The inconsistent Falcons beat the equally inconsistent Raiders. The Bills beat the Chargers, the Giants beat the Bengals and the Titans beat the Colts. The Browns beat the Jaguars. The Vikings won a much needed victory against the Panthers. The Patriots looked pathetic in their win over the Cardinals.

The Dolphins beat the still winless Jets. The Saints without their starting quarterback beat the Broncos without any quarterback! The 49ers won against the Rams. The Tom Brady Buccaneers lost to the Chiefs. The Packers beat the Bears, and the Seahawks beat the Eagles in what normally would have been the last game of the week! But wait, it's  a Christmas miracle! The Steelers and Ravens were rescheduled to play a new Wednesday night - er I mean afternoon (really?) game in which the Steelers won; remaining the only undefeated team.

  All in all a great week of football!

Don't despair if you did not do well. It is still early in the season! Plenty of time too move up!
