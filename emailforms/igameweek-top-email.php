The third week of the 2019 season is in the bag. Team identities are being sculpted. Making picks will require more energy from those tiny gray cells!
</p> 

<p>
The Jaguars won their first and looked much better as they pummeled the hapless Titans. The Lions beat the Eagles but still need to stop making foolish mistakes. The Patriots routed the leaderless Jets. The Vikings put together a fine win against a pesky Raiders team. The Chiefs beat the Ravens in a slug fest. The Colts beat the struggling Falcons. The Packers beat the now 0 - 3 Broncos.  
</p> 

<p>
The Cowboys crushed a pathetic Dolphins team. The surprising Bills beat the Bengals to remain tied with the Patriots at 3 - 0. Those two will play next week. Two go in - one comes out! The Giants scraped by the Buccaneers with a last second field goal. The Panthers without their starting quarterback beat the Cardinals. The 49ers beat the Steelers in a game fraught with turnovers.
</p> 

<p>
The Saints without their starting quarterback beat the Seahawks. The Texans were last man standing in a back and forth contest against the Chargers. The Rams squeaked by the Browns and in the final game of the week; da Bears pounded the Redskins.
</p> 

<p>
  All in all a superb week of football!
</p>
