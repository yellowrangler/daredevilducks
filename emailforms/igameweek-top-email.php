The Ravens beat the Texans decisively in the first Saturday Wildcard weekend game. In the second Saturday game the 49ers won over the Packers in a closer contest.

In the first Sunday game, the Lions beat the Buccaneers in a competitive match. In the second and final Sunday game, the Chiefs beat the Bills in a heart breaker for the Bills. Seems like missing last second field goals is still in the Bills DNA.
