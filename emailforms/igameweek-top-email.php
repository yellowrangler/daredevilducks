In Sunday games - The Browns beat the Ravens in an upset. The Lions beat the Titans. The Texans beat the Colts. The Packers beat the Jaguars. The Cardinals beat the Dolphins with a last second field goal. The Patriots upset the Jets. The Falcons beat the Buccaneers. The Commanders beat the Bears in a wild affair featuring a last second Hail Mary pass that won the game! The Chargers zapped the Saints. The Bills trampled the Seahawks. The Eagles beat the Bengals. The Broncos beat the Panthers. The Chiefs beat the Raiders. Is it only me? It seems like lately the Chiefs 12th man on the field is the officiating crew? The 49ers beat the Cowboys.
