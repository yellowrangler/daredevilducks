  It was a good 5th week of football. 
</p>

<p>
The Colts beat the Broncos in Denver to open the week. In jolly old England, in a bit of an upset, the Giants beat the Packers. The Bills crushed the Steelers. The Chargers came back from the dead to beat the Browns in Cleveland! The Texans beat the Jaguars in Jacksonville. The Vikings held on to beat the Bears. The Saints beat the Seahawks. The Patriots, without their starting quarterback, beat the Lions. The Jets beat the Dolphins.
</p> 

<p>
The Buccaneers beat the Falcons. The Titans played well enough to bet the Commanders in Washington. The 49ers beat the Panthers in North Carolina. The Eagles beat the Cardinals to stay perfect. The Cowboys beat the Rams. In a close match, the Ravens beat the Bengals.

<p>
In the final game of week 5 the Chiefs defeated the Raiders in a game that went down to the final seconds!
