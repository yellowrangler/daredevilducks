The Chiefs beat the Ravens in the first Conference playoff game. The Ravens looked out of sorts from the start. They played punishing football but didn't come together until it was too late. Meanwhile, the Chiefs looked very good in all facets of the game. This may be a great chance for them to win a back to back Super Bowl.
