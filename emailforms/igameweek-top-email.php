In their best game of the season, the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the high scoring and heavenly favored Kansas City Chiefs. Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs who had never had a sub 2 digit score, were consistently mauled by the Buccaneer defense. Meanwhile, Tom Brady, with a steady hand, made no mistakes and lead the Buccaneers consistently down field for scores. For Chiefs fans this was a disaster, for Buccaneer fans a dream come true. While a Wuhan virus plagued season may take some of the luster off the year for some, it was still a great game. Forget the Tom Brady story, this was a Buccaneers team that played with great heart against a Chiefs team that was not prepared!
