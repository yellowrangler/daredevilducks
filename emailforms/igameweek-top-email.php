In the NFC conference playoffs the Eagles beat the 49ers. The 49ers lost both their second and third string quarter backs early in the game. I have never seen such a thing happen. It was a shame as it reduced the game to a fete de complete for the Eagles!

In the AFC conference playoffs the Chiefs beat the Bengals. It was a competitive match up. Unfortunately for Cincinnati penalties where devastating. Especially the last penalty which put the Chiefs in range for a winning field goal!
