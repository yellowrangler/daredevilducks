Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
Another great win for the Patriots. Vengence may be the Lords province but it seems payback is the Patriots. At least it was last Sunday. What a great game. The Broncos fought as much with each other as with the Pats. TJ Ward got the Bonehead Award for the game as he body slammed Edelmen and then had the cheek to flex for the viewing audience! That bit of chivalry sealed the win for the Patriots. What a frigging jerk. You can't make this stuff up!

This was a defining week for a number of teams. The Dolphins kept their playoff hopes alive with a win over the truely pathetic Jets. The Titans remain in the hunt with a win over the mecurial Chiefs. The Steelers looked strong as they put the nail in the Bengals season. The Giants continue to impress as they beat the Lions. The Texans benched their high priced quaterback on the way to a win over the Jaguars. The Bills kept their playoff hopes alive with a win over the winless Browns. The Ravens kept up with the Steelers as they dispatched the Eagles.

The Raiders took care of business as they beat the Chargers. The Buccaneers gave Dallas almost more then they could take in a great game. But Dallas showed their mettle and prevailed. The final game pitted Carolona against Washington. This was a tough game for Redskin fans as Carolina won the day.

This is the time of year that footbal is at it's best. Bubble teams fighting for a shot and dominant teams trying to maintain their MoJo.
