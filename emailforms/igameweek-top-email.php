Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
A necessary win for the Patriots. The boys from New England secured home field advantage through-out the playoffs! It was a tight game until a Damien Williams fortuitous fumble put any chance of a Dolphins comeback to bed. Gird your loins folks, because the playoffs have started! It is game on.
</p>

<p>
The Steelers eeked out an overtime win over the Browns in a game that meant nothing other then pride. The Giants beat the Redskins out of the playoffs. The Broncos got some swager back in a meaningless game for them by spanking the quaterback-less Raiders. The Falcons beat the Saints, the Chiefs beat the Chargers and the Packers beat the Lions in a game that was supposed to feature a winner take all but instead found both allready in the playoffs. 
</p> 

<p>
I can't believe the regular season is over. Can you? It feels like the year just started! But this is where the fun starts. I feel we have a good representation of the cream of the NFL. There are always exceptions; but as the soothsayer told Ceaser - be wary the exceptions of January/February! Ha ha!    
</p>
