Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
A so  so win for the Patriots. The Steelers are a tough defensive group and chippy to boot! But they have lost a great deal with Roethlisberger being out.Thank goodness for LeGarrette Blount. With out him the Patriots might not have had a running game. And that would have made it infinitely harder for Brady to pass! But a win is a win!  
</p>

<p>
The Chiefs won again beating the Saints in a tight contest. The Vikings finally lost their first game to the Eagles. The Redskins lost to the Lions in a close contest. The Jets beat the Ravens and fond, lost and fond a new quarter back - again. The Chargers beat the Falcons in an upset.
</p>

<p>
The Seahawks Cardinals overtime ended in a tie. That game feature two chances by each team to win by completing a field goal less then 15 yards from the uprights. And both teams missed. Kind of makes me wonder about league integrity. I will leave it there. 
</p>

<p>
All in all a good/weird week. But then we ARE close to Halloween.
