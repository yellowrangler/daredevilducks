End to the seventh week of the Season!
</p> 

<p>
Spooky, Yes? Trees turning color and the temperature is starting to dip. Must be football season!
</p>

<p>
In the first game, two bottom dwellers slugged it out. In the end the Eagles beat the Giants. In the contest of the two teams that always seem to find a way to loose in the end; the Lions held on to beat the Falcons. The Steelers continued to remain perfect by beating the Titans in a lively contest. The Browns beat the Bengals in a very watchable back and forth affair. The Packers beat the Texans, the Saints beat the Panthers and the Bills beat the Jets. The Washingtons beat the quickly fading Cowboys.

The Chargers handily beat the Jaguars. The Chiefs massacred the Broncos. The 49ers crushed the Patriots. The Tom Brady Buccaneers continue to impress, as they boarded and sank the Raiders. In the upset of the week the Cardinals eeked by the Seahawks. In the final contest, the Rams pummeled the Bears.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
</p>

<p>
Don't despair if you did not do well. It is still early in the season! Plenty of time too move up!
