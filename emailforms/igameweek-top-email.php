The fifth week of the 2019 season is in the bag. The Daredevil Ducks rankings continue to churn!
</p> 

<p>
The Seahawks beat the Rams in a squeaker! The Cam Newton-less Panthers beat the mighty Minshew Jaguars. The Cardinals got their first win over the hopeless Bengals. The Texans tortured the flightless Falcons and Bree-less Saints boarded and defeated the Buccaneers (Yar).
</p> 

<p>
The Vikings crushed the Giants. The Raiders skinned the Bears in Jolly Olde England. The winless Jets stayed that way as they were grounded by the Eagles. The Ravens beat the Steelers in a close contest. The Bills edged past the Titans and the Patriots beat the Jay Gruden out of the Redskins!
</p> 

<p>
The Broncos got their first win of the season over the lackluster Chargers. The Packers beat the Cowboys in a thrilling contest. The Colts upset the Chiefs at (Ma)home and in the last game of the week the 49ers dismantled the Browns.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
