<p>A great start to the football season!  
</p>	
<p>	
	The Patriots came out strong against the Texans but started to fade later in the game. The defence looks good this year, but offence needs more consitency. In the end the Patriots held on for a win! The Vikings beat the 49ers in a good game. Both teams looked good. The Buccaneers beat the Saints behind a masterful performance by Brian Fitzpatrick. The Jaguars beat the woefull looking Giants. The Bengals beat the Colts in a hard hitting game. The Browns held the struggling Steelers to a tie. The Ravens looked impressive thumping the hapless Bills. The Chiefs and Chargers slugged it out in the Chargers new home stadium. The Chiefs won the contest helped by the Chargers recievers inability to hold on to the ball. The Redskins looked very good as they pummled the Cardenals. The Cowboys looked disfunctional in their loss to the Panthers. The Broncos rallied to beat the Seahawks in an entertaining match. The Packers behind Aaron Rodgers beat the impressive looking Bears in a miricle finash. The Jets looked impressive in their dismantling of the Detroit Lions. Tough start for Patricia. In the final contest the Rams pounded the Raiders.
<br /><br />
  All in all a tremendous start to the season!
