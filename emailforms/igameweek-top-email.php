  It was a good third week of football. 
</p>

<p>
The Browns and Steelers opened the week in an important divisional matchup that the Browns won. The Panthers got their first win defeating the Saints. The Bears won a close game over the Texans. The Colts got their first win over the highly touted Chiefs. The Dolphins handed the high flying Bills their first loss in an exciting back and forth affair. The Vikings narrowly pulled a victory over the much improved Lions.
</p> 

<p>
The Ravens beat the Patriots in Foxborough. The Bengals got their first win against the Jets. The Titans got their first win against the winless Raiders. The Eagles remained undefeated as they mauled the Commanders. In an upset of sorts, the Jaguars beat the Chargers. Atlanta beat the Seahawks. Green Bay gave the Buccaneers their first loss in Tampa Bay. The Broncos held on to defeat the 49ers.

In the final game of week 3 the Cowboys defeated the Giants in New York!

Don't be disappointed if you are not basking in the upper wins tier! It is still very early in the season. Just keep sharpening your pencil and encourage those little grey cells to do their stuff! You can do it!
