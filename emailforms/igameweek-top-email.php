The regular season is in the books! On to the playoffs!
</p> 

<p>
I hope you all are having, or had a Happy New Year! This week is the round 1 Wild Card Weekend (week 18). Lets review what happened last week.
</p> 

<p>
The Ravens, without Lamar Jackson, beat the Steelers. The end of a frustrating season for a great franchise. The Jets beat the Bills in a meaningless game. The Saints crushed the Panthers. The Bengals beat the hapless, leaderless and now coachless Browns. The Cowboys scalped the Indians; bringing to mind the phrase - too little, too late! 
</p> 

<p>
The Packers beat the Lions. The Titans beat the Texans earning them a place in the playoffs. The Colts lost to the Jaguars.  The Chiefs beat the Chargers to secure a bye and the number 2 seed. The Bears beat the Vikings in Minnesota. One has to think that the Vikings aren't going anywhere if they can't beat the Bears at home.
</p> 

<p>
The Patriots looked awful in a loss to Miami in Foxborough. A Patriots win would have given them a bye and second seed. The Pats better dig deep if they want to advance any further. The Eagles crushed the Giants to secure a playoff berth. The Falcons came from behind to beat the Buccaneers. The Raiders lost to the Broncos and the Rams beat the Cardinals.
</p> 

<p>
And in the final game of the week, the 49ers beat the Seahawks to secure the division title and first seed. 
</p>

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
</p> 

<p>
The number one spot is crowded! It is now a small fraternity of those who can be a Daredevil ducks champion. To those few, pick wisely as the number of games is coming to a dramatic close. Good luck to all! To the rest of us (including myself), enjoy the sprint to the finish!
