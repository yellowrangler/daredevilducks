The 12th week of the 2019 season is in the bag. The Daredevil Ducks rankings still continue to churn!
</p> 

<p>
I hope everyone is ready for Thanksgiving! Football is fun, but it will never hold a candle to friends and family. There is so much for us all to be thankful for. On to football.
</p> 

<p>
The Texans corralled the Colts in a close game. The Buccaneers crushed the mercurial Falcons. The Bills rode the Broncos to victory. The Bears beat the Giants in the booooring game of the week. And the Steelers beat the Bengals and changed their starting quarterback.
</p> 

<p>
The Browns squished the fish, as the Dolphins lost yet again. The Saints squeaked by the Panthers in a very competitive endeavor. In the upset of the week, the Jets pounded the Raiders. The Redskins won only their second game as they eased past the Lions. The Titans have finally found their quarterback in Ryan Tannehill. They easily dispatched the Jaguars. In the game of the week, the Patriots played well enough to beat the less-then-promised Cowboys. The 49ers looked very super bowl-ish as they crushed the Packers in San Fransisco. 
</p> 

<p>
The Seahawks won a low scoring contest over the fading Eagles. In the final contest, the Ravens embarrassed the Rams. In that game the Ravens looked quite super bowl-ish themselves.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
</p> 

<p>
There is still time to make a run. Get your strategies under control. Time for the cream to rise to the top! You get the point - Do your JOB!
