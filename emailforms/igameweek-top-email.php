	We have introduced a new member <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;'>ChartMan</span>! ChartMan only picks the winners by looking at the <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;'>Teams Stats</span> popup on the <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:900;'>Pick your Teams</span> page! It will be interesting to see how he does against those of us (me included) who think through our own picks. Kind of like putting money in stock market indexes verses active investing!
