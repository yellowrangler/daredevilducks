<p>Week 9 is in the books! On to Week 10! 
</p>	
<p>	
The Patriots beat the Packers in one of the best Patriot games for this season. The Patriots defense rose to the occasion and the offense scored enough to win. The 49ers beat the hapless Raiders. The Steelers beat the Ravens in a tough contest. The Bears crushed the Bills. The Panthers crushed the Buccaneers. The Chiefs beat the Browns and the Dolphins beat the Jest in a snooze fest. The Vikings pounded the Lions. The Falcons punished the Redskins. The Texans won a nail biter as Denver missed a last second field goal that would have won the game. The Chargers looked very impressive in their win over the Seahawks. And the Cowboys looked awful in their loss to the Titans.
<br /><br />
  All in all a good week of football!
