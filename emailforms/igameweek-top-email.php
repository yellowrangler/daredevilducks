<p>
The Commanders eked a win over the Bears to open the week. In a upset, the Falcons crushed the 49ers. The Patriots spanked the Browns. After trailing most of the game, the Colts beat the Jaguars. In another upset, the Jets beat the Packers in Green Bay. The Vikings squished the fish in Miami. The Bengals outlasted the Saints.

<p>
The surprise Giants beat the Ravens. The Steelers beat the Buccaneers in one of the best games of the week. The Rams beat the Panthers. The Seahawks beat the disappointing Cardinals. The Bills beat the Chiefs in a thriller. The Eagles remained unbeaten as they dispatched the Cowboys.

In the final game of week 6 the Chargers defeated the Broncos in a back and forth game that went to overtime!
