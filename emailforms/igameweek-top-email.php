End to the eighth week of the Season!
</p> 

<p>
Let us all take the time to pause and be Thankful for all that we have!
</p>

<p>
In the first game, the Falcons beat the Panthers. In a squeaker the Bills beat the Patriots. The Bengals are starting to come together as they beat the Titans. The Raiders boarded and ravaged the Browns. The Colts beat the very disappointing Lions. The Vikings upset the Packers in Green Bay. The Chiefs scalped the low flying Jets and the Dolphins, with their new first round pick quarterback, beat the Rams.
</p>


<p>
The Steelers stayed undefeated by beating their divisional nemesis, the Ravens. The Broncos came from behind to shock the Chargers. The Saints beat the Bears, the Seahwks beat the 49ers and Eagles beat the Cowboys. In the final contest, the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the New York Giants.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
</p>

<p>
Don't despair if you did not do well. It is still early in the season! Plenty of time too move up!  
</p> 

<p>
The full stats are below! Read em and weep (I know I do)!
