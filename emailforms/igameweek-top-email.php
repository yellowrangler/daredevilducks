Let us all take the time to pause and be Thankful for all that we have!
</p>

<p>
In the first game, the Seahawks won a close match against the Cardinals. The Titans beat the Ravens. The Panthers beat the Lions. The Browns won over the Eagles, and the Patriots lost a heart breaker with the Texans. No playoffs for you! The Colts in a bit of an  upset, beat the Packers.
</p>

The Steelers stayed undefeated as they easily dispatched the Jaguars. The Saints beat the Falcons, the Washingtons beat the Bengals and the Chargers beat the winless Jets. Denver beat the Dolphins. Dallas beat the disappointing Vikings. The Chiefs behind Mahome, came back from behind to beat the Raiders. In the final game, the Rams beat the Tom Brady Buccaneers.

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
</p>

<p>
Don't despair if you did not do well. It is still early in the season! Plenty of time too move up!
