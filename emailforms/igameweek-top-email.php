Hi <span style='color:teal;'>All Daredevil Ducks members</span>,

What a great week of playoffs! Now we enter into the final conference challenges from which will emerge our Super Bowl contenders!

The Packers did it again with their wily quarterback. Do not despair Dallas fans; they are a young team and should be back. BUt what a great game! The Steelers and Chiefs brought it down to the last second. All in all the best teams in football are left to slug it out.
