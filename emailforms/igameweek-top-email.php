Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
A good win for the Patriots. The Rams are not exactly championship material; but we actually were able to put pressure on the quaterback! Secondary still looks a bit iffy. Next game against the Ravens will be very telling. Good for Brady passing all to become winningest quaterback of all time! Unfortunately another week with 'uneven' officiating. Maybe Roger could use some of his excessive compensation to make officials full time profesionals.  
</p>

<p>
The Cowboys and the Chiefs had heart stopping endings. The Texans and Eagles continue their downward spiral. The Steelers looked very impressive in their big win over the Giants. The Cardinals kept themselves statistically in the hunt for a wildcard by beating the Readskins. The Panthers and Colts disproved the addage - it can't get any worse then this.
</p>

<p>
All in all a good week of football.
