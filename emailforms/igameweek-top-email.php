In the Saturday Divisional games - the <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Chiefs</span> beat the <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Texans</span> in a game with very critical questionable calls against the Texans. It's hard enough to beat the Chiefs without NFL officiating seemingly being a part of the Chiefs bench! In the night game the <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Commanders</span> upset the highly favored <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Lions</span>!

The <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Bills</span> beat the <span style='font-weight:bold;color:#1280d6;'>Ravens</span> in another close and exciting contest!
