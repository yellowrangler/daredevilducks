The Conference playoff Weekend is over! On to the Super Bowl!
</p> 

<p>
This week is the Super Bowl (week 21). Lets review what happened last week.
</p> 

<p>
In the first Sunday game the Chiefs won over the Titans. The Titans put in a valiant effort and actually had the lead early on in the game. But the Chiefs just played too well; and in the end overwhelmed the Titans. A great game! 
</p> 

<p>
In the second Sunday game, the 49ers beat the Packers. This was never a close game. The Packers earned respectability with a couple of very late charges but fell short. Rogers looked bored and unengaged in this mans view. Still it was a game worth watching, as the 49ers - normally a passing team - ran the ball most of the game with great results.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football! 
</p>

It is now a very very small fraternity of those who can be a Daredevil ducks champion. Only <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Team Remington</span> and <span style='color:#FF6E3B;font-weight:700;'>Empty Nesters</span> have any shot at the title! Good luck to all! To the rest of us (including myself), enjoy the sprint to the finish!
