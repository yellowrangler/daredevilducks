In the opening game, the Texans put an old style shellacking on the Browns.  Too many mistakes by Cleveland! In a return to the ice age (Climate Warming? Really?) the Chiefs beat the warm weather Dolphins. Just saying...
</p>

The Packers upset the Cowboys in Dallas! Jerry Jones looked like he was ready to skin someone. Belichick opportunity? The Lions beat the Rams in  nail biter! The old quarterback for the Rams, who was now the quarterback for the Lions, beat the former quarterback of the Lions who was now the quarterback for the Rams. Yea... Try saying that 5 times fast! At the snow bowl, the Bills beat a tough Steelers team.

In the final game of the week, the Buccaneers crushed the disappointing Eagles. The Eagles are another team where changes will be coming!
