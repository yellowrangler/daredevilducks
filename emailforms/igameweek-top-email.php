In the first game the Steelers beat the Titans. The Chiefs beat the Dolphins in Germany. In one of the more entertaining contests, the Vikings came back and beat the Falcons. The Browns beat the Cardinals. The Packers beat the Rams. In an amazing back and forth affair, the Texans showed their mettle as they came back to beat the Buccaneers.

	As Veterans Day approaches it is time to remember all who not only served, but also those who gave their life in service to this country. 
</p>

	When Wildcat Wonder and I travel west we always stop at American Legion Post 639 named LZ639 after an American submarine whose conning tower sits in a park set aside for veterans. I bring this up because while neither Wildcat Wonder or myself have served; they have always been more then hospitable letting us park our Airstream trailer overnight. Really great people, with strong community values and community support for those who serve.

	If you are ever driving through Springfield Missouri stop by, have a pop and meet some friendly folks! They are populated by the true patriots of the United States of America.

We are through half the regular season! Time is  ticking! Tick. tick, tick...
