End to the second week of the Season!
</p> 

<p>
In the first game, the winless Browns beat the winless Bengals in a back and forth effort. The Bears continued their winning streak by beating the still winless Giants. The Cowboys poached the game away from the luckless Falcons by recovering a squibbed onside kick that became a game winning field goal kick. The Packers came back and drilled the cowardly Lions. The Colts trampled the Vikings, while the Bills squeaked by the Dolphins.

<p>
The 49ers bludgeoned the Jets but lost some valuable players in the process. The Rams beat the Eagles, the Steelers beat the Broncos and the Tom Brady Buccaneers beat the Panthers. The Titans beat the Jaguars and the undefeated Cardinals beat the Washington TBDs. The Ravens beat the winless Texans, the Chiefs survived a nail bitter against the Chargers and the Patriots lost to the Seahawks in Seattle. In the final contest, the undefeated Raiders beat the Saints.
</p>

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
</p>
