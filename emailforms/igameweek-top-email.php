The week got started with the Colts crushing and grounding the low flying Jets.
</p>

<p>
The Falcons beat the Saints in a great back and forth affair! The Broncos stampeded the Cowboys. The Patriots stayed relevant as they dispatched the Panthers. The Ravens beat the Vikings, who continue to find ways to loose. The Browns thumped the Bengals. In the upset of the week, the Jaguars beat the Bills.
</p>

<p>
The Dolphins beat the hapless Texans. The Giants stayed in the game long enough to beat the Raiders. The Chargers beat the Eagles. The Chiefs beat the Rogers-less Packers in a game that saw only 13 points scored by the normally high scoring Chiefs. The Cardinals humbled the 49ers. In the best game of the week, the Titans, without their star running back Henry (out for the season), put a great game plan together and beat a very good Rams team. 
</p>

<p>
In the last game of the week, the Steelers held on to beat the Bears!
