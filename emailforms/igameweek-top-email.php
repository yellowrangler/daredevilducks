The 10th week of the 2019 season is in the bag. The Daredevil Ducks rankings still continue to churn!
</p> 

<p>
Yikes! We at Daredevil Ducks apologize to our members for missing our usually captivating breakdown for last weeks games. We will try and DO OUR JOB better in the weeks to come! 
</p> 

<p>
The Raiders beat the disappearing Chargers. The Bears beat the cowardly Lions. The Ravens eviscerated the winless Bengals. The Browns squeaked by the Bills. The Packers beat the Panthers with a great deal of help from the referees.
</p> 

<p>
In an upset of sorts, the Falcons beat the Saints. In the battle for New York, the Jets beat the Giants. The Buccaneers eased by the Cardinals. In another upset, the Titans beat the suddenly struggling Chiefs. The Dolphins beat the Brissett-less Colts, and the Steelers won over the fading Rams.
</p> 

<p>
In the final two games (and best in my opinion) The Vikings beat the Cowboys in Dallas. And on Monday night, the Seahawks beat the undefeated 49ers in a thrilling overtime match.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
</p> 

<p>
