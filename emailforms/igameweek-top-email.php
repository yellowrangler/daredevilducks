The 12th week of the 2019 season is in the bag. The Daredevil Ducks rankings still continue to churn!
</p> 

<p>
I hope everyone survived their Thanksgiving! But there is more coming, as Christmas is just around the corner! On to football.
</p> 

<p>
In the first of the Thanksgiving trifectas, the Bears beat the cowardly Lions. In an upset of sorts, the Bills beat the Cowboys in Dallas. In the final Thanksgiving game, the Saints clinched their NFC South title with a win over the Falcons.
</p> 

<p>
In the game of the week, the Ravens beat the 49ers in a back and forth affair, where a last second field goal produced the win. The Redskins beat the Ron Rivera out of the Panthers. The winless Bengals got their first win by decisively beating the Jets. The Titans looked good beating the Colts. The Buccaneers beat the Jaguars. The Chiefs crushed the collapsing Raiders. The Dolphins beat the disappointing Eagles in Miami. The Packers crushed the going-no-where Giants.
</p> 

<p>
The Rams finally put a complete game together as they easily dispatched the Cardinals. The Broncos with a new quarterback beat the fading Chargers with a last second field goal. The Steelers beat the Browns in their second meeting. The Texans beat a sluggish Patriots team.
</p>

<p>
In the final contest, the Seahawks bested the Vikings in a squeaker.
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
</p> 

<p>
There is still time to make a run, but the noose is closing! Get your strategies under control. Time for the cream to rise to the top! You get the point - Do your JOB!
