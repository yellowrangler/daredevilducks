The first game pitched the defending 2022 Super Bowl Champs Chiefs against the upstart Lions in Kansas. In a thriller the Lions beat the Chiefs by 1 point! The Falcons looked strong as they dispatched the Panthers who rolled out their highly touted draft pick Bryce Young. The Browns crushed the Bengals. The Jaguars with Trevor Lawrence beat the Colts. The Buccaneers without Tom Brady beat the Vikings! The Saints with Derek Car beat the disappointing Titans. The 49ers crushed the Steelers in Pittsburgh. The Ravens corralled the Texans. The Commanders beat the Cardinals.

The Rogers-less Packers beat the Bears. The Raiders with their new quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo held on to beat the Broncos. The Eagles eeked a win over the Patriots in Foxborough. The Dolphins won in a squeaker over the Chargers. The Rams played well as they dispatched an equally good Seahawks team. The Cowboys absolutely stampeded the pathetic Giants.

In the final game, the Jets beat the highly touted Bills in a game that saw the Jets new all star quarterback, Rodgers, injured on the first series of downs. Mistakes by the Bills Allen and the strength of the Jets defense defined the story!
