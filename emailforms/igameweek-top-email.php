The 15th week of the 2019 season is in the bag. The Daredevil Ducks rankings still continue to churn!

Christmas is right around the corner. Time to bring family and friends together to celebrate the birth of Christ. Time also for these darn referees to start getting their collective act together and start making consistent calls! God bless all our members and let us pray for Peace on Earth! On to football!

The Ravens continued there relentless carnage on the NFL as they punished the Jets. The Seahawks beat the Panthers to tie the 49ers for first place in their division. The Patriots beat the hapless Bengals in Foxborough. The Buccaneers beat the Lions to even their record. The Packers beat the Bears.
</p> 

<p>
The Chiefs beat the Broncos is a snow-globe. The Giants beat the Dolphins. The Bills beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh. The Bills are for real! The Texans beat the Titans in a close game marred by more bad refereeing. The Eagles beat the Redskins to stay alive in the divisional hunt. The Cardinals clipped the mercurial Browns. In their last game in Oakland, the Raiders lost to the Jaguars. The Cowboys finally looked like the team they have been hyped to be - as they crushed the Rams. In an upset, the Falcons beat the 49ers. The Vikings beat the disappearing Chargers.
</p> 

<p>
And in the final game of the week, the Saints put a whooping on the fading Colts. 
</p>

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football!
</p>

There is very little time to make a run for some, but the noose is closing! Get your strategies under control. Time for the cream to rise to the top! You get the point - Do your JOB!
