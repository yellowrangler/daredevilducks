The Playoff are here and what a great regular season we had. This is our favorite time of the year. Savor it as you watch it because it will be over in the blink of an eye.

The Colts crushed the Texans in the first contest of the playoffs. The much vaulted Texan defense was unable to stop Andrew Luck as the Colts put all the points that they needed up in the first half. The anemic and over hyped Texas offense led by Watson manged only 7 points. Watch out for the Colts!

The Cowboys beat a good Seahaks team. Neither team looked invincible, as the game was at times a bit of a snooze. But a win gets you another day. The Cowboys will have to play very well to continue to the Super bowl.

The Chargers beat the Ravens in a great game. It was a hard hitting contest with the difference being each teams quarterback. Both teams played a solid defense. In the end, Jackson just was too one dimensional and could not make the required plays. While I stand with the Patriots, there is something eminently likable about Phil Rivers and this entire Charger team. They play the Patriots next which will be there greatest test to date.

The Eagles beat the Bears in the craziest game of the week. This was a game where both teams played well. The game swung back and forth. Foles brought the Eagles down and scored putting the Eagles in the lead with seemingly very little time on the clock; only to have Mitch Trubisky bring the Bears to within field goal range (43 yards) and the win. The Bears kicker hit both the upright and the horizontal bar eventually bouncing forward back out onto the field. It was a tough loss for the Bears, and another part of the Philadelphia miracle as they continue to just win.

<p>
  All in all a great week of football!
