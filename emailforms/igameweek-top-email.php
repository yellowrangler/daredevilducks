This year represents the one-hundredth NFL season. We are sure to be subjected to copious amounts of NFL nostalgia throughout these games. Be prepared for many journeys in Mr Peabody's wayback machine (if you dont understand the reference your too young).

The first week of the 2019 season is finally tucked away. Not the best played week in football, but there were some great finishes! We started with the Packers against da Bears. Not a pretty game as neither team looked dominant. The difference was Rodgers ability to connect with Graham for the only touchdown. Green Bay wins. The Redskins and Eagles battled back and forth. Both teams looked good to me. Eagles outlast Redskins to win. The Bills and Jets was a sloppy game to watch. It had a nail biter ending, with the Bills winning by scoring last and recovering a Jets fumble with twelve seconds left.

The Vikings spanked an anemic looking Atlanta. The Ravens embarrassed Miami, leaving pundits to anoint Miami as most likely to receive the number one college draft pick. The Chiefs looked very good as they crushed the undisciplined Jaguars. The Titans spoiled the Browns home opener intercepting Mayfield three times on their way to a 43 to 13 win. The Rams beat the Panthers in a close contest. The Seahawks beat the Bengals by 1. The Chargers beat the Luck-less Colts. The 49ers beat the Buccaneers. The Cowboys crushed the Giants.

The Lions tied the Cardinals in a game where the Lions had the game won. The Patriots looked steady in their win as they easily handled the Steelers. It was a momentous evening as the Patriots had their sixth super bowl banner raised prior to kickoff! The Texans lost to the Saints in the weeks most exciting game. The Saints won on a last second 58 yard field goal by Lutz. The Raiders beat the Broncos in the final contest.

  All in all a superb week of football!
