Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
A great win for the Patriots. This was a great game even though both sides were plagued with foolish mistakes. The Ravens dropped more passes and the Patriots punt return team looked clueless. But still! What a great game. Two teams that may meet agin in the playoffs. Two teams that do not like each other. Two physical teams. It is unfortunate that the closer we get to the end of the season - the better the good teams play.

The Chiefs are again getting some momentum. They are not flashy or boastful, they are plodders. May the earth be inspired by that sence of purpose and demeaner! The Steelers let the Bills get closer then they wanted,  but still took the win. The Titans beat the Broncos to get a tie for first place in their division. The Redskins beat the Eagles who are slowly sinking into the east. The Falcons put a whopping on the Saints perhaps costing Jeff Fisher his coaching job. The Packers humbled the bully Seahawks to stay in the playoff race. And the Cowboys looked good but could not score giving the Giants a 10 to 7 win!
</p>

<p>
All in all a good week of football.
