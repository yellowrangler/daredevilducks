The Divisional Playoff Weekend is over! On to the Conference Playoffs!
</p> 

<p>
This week is the round 3 Conference Playoffs (week 20). Lets review what happened last week.
</p> 

<p>
In the first Saturday game the 49ers won over the Vikings. The game started out close, but San Fransisco proved too good as they ran away in the second half. 
</p> 

<p>
In the second Saturday game, the Titans, behind the punishing running of Henry, beat the vaulted Ravens. It was a game hearkening back to the good old days of football where a balance of running and passing won the day. In the end the raw talent of Lamar could not overcome the more steady and disciplined Titans defense! 
</p> 

<p>
In the first Sunday game, the Chiefs crushed the Texans in a game where the Texans scored the first 21 points in a seeming runaway. Only to have the Chiefs come fighting back and then some! Very impressive game for Chief fans.
</p> 

<p>
In the second Sunday game, the Packers beat the Seahawks. This was a close game that featured some big plays in the weaning minutes of the game by the Packers to keep the Seahawks offense off the field. 
</p> 

<p>
 All in all a superb week of football! 
</p> 

<p>
It is now a very small fraternity of those who can be a Daredevil ducks champion. To those few, pick wisely as the number of games is coming to a dramatic close. Good luck to all! To the rest of us (including myself), enjoy the sprint to the finish!
