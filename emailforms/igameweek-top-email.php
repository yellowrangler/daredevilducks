Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
A necessary win for the Patriots. The boys from New England pummeled the haples Jets. Our defence continues to improve which is a MUST because the cream is starting to rise to the top. The Steelers, Chiefs and Raiders are all peaking (More on Oakland later). All in all its is shaping up to be a fine playoff year! 
</p>

<p>
The Giants got their butts whipped by an out of contention Eagles team. Not a good game for Giants fans. The Packers extended their playoff hopes by beating the Vikings. Reports have surfased that some of the Viking secondry disregarded the game plan in favor of what they thought was best. I wonder what Belichick would have done? Hmmmm. Big (BIG) game for Packers and Lions next week. The Falcons and the Redskins took care of business by easily dispatching their rivals. The Texans eacked out a win over the Bengals to get into the playoffs. They did it with Tom Savage as their quaterback. What a great name. Sounds like it was made for Hollywood doesn't it? Pittsburg won their bigget game of the year in exciting fashion beating the Ravens with only seconds left. I believe that Roethlisberger and Brady are the two best 2 minute and under quaterbacks when you need a score. Great game.

The Chiefs took out the Broncos in spectacular fashion including a final score that featured their 350 pound nose tackle Dontari Poein as full back shot putting the ball to a reciever Demetrius Harris in the endzone. That win removed the Broncos from the playoffs and capped a disappointing year for Denver fans. Dallas finished off our Christmas week games with a thrashing of the Detriot Lions.

Two very sad and unfortunate injuries occured this week each entailing low twisting tackles. I LOVE football; but I hate what I see as exagerted violence on the field. That is violence perpetrated for only one reason and that is to injure a player. The league practically trips over itself with their 'concussion protocol' and yet ignores shameless 'Leagl' hits that have only one purpase in mind, to injure. I am not suggesting that these two tackles were intened to harm. I have not studied the video. But I am concerened that there is a level of thugary that is encouraged through out the NFL (Ya - I am talking to you Pete Carroll). Cant we all just play ball?
