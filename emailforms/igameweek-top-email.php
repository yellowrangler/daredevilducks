The first game found the 49ers with a win over the Giants. The Browns crushed the Titans. The Lions looked good besting the Falcons. In a real squeaker, the Packers beat the Saints. The Texans beat the struggling Jaguars in Jacksonville. The Dolphins took their third in a row over the winless Broncos. The Chargers got their first win over the winless Vikings.
