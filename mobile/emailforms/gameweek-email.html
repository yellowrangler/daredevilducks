Hi Folks,

<br />

<p>
It a strange third week for football! 
</p>
<p>
The football pundits overwelmingly picked the Patriots to loose against the Texans Thursday night. And why not. They were on a short week that saw their second string quaterback go down, their third string quaterback had not had any  regular reps, and the vaunted JJ Watt was back on the field. SWEET! One for the ages folks (my oppologies to the non Patriots fans out there - that means you Brian). That was a fun game for Patriots fans. 
</p>

<p>
Of course there were OTHER games this week! The Redskins beat the Giants in a thrilling squeeker. The Browns and the Dolphins played a big ugly (my opinion), each trying their best to loose. The Vikings continue to impress by beating the Panthers. The Bill's stuned the football world by tourching the Cardinals (Though 7 of you thought strongly enough to select them). What in the world is going on with the Cardinals? The Eagles pulled off a huge win beating the Steelers. Not sure what this means for eather team, though I still believe the Steelers are one of the teams to beat. The Bears and Cutler look awful and the Falcons Saints finale was a scoring fest. I could have done with out all the blah blah blah regarding Katrina. When did sports become so intertwined (empahsis on wine) with political spin? But I digress.
</p>

<p>
We had another great turnout this week. Thank you all again for participating. NFL Amateur is like Godzilla rumaging through Tokyo as she retains sole command of first place (by 3 games) on the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:maroon;'>Total Games Won Leader</span> board! She is followed by Empty Nesters and Kathie (with others) at second place. 
</p>
<p>
NFL Amateur has also taken command of first place (75%) of the <span style='font-weight:bold; color:blue;'>Total Percentage Leader</span> Board. She is followed by Scotsman357 and Tight End.
</p>
<p>
For <span style='font-weight:bold; color:#228b22;'>Player Weekly Totals</span> bragging rights we have 18 Wheeler, ANTIC and Empty Nesters toping the list with 12 wins! Way to go folks. Thats what I like about this game. So many levels to be da man (or woman). The stats are below. Read em and weep (I know I do)!
